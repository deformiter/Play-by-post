As Arden closes his eyes for a second, and the rest of the party takes some time to bandage their wounds...Only Tova seems to sense the danger that lies and waits in the tomb...

Having spent some time barricading the door coming into the cave but not really doing much to seal up the new passage, you Tova see as billowing shadows coalesce into an opaque, smoke-like body of black, blue and green...The figure slowly drifting toward you accross the floor as if the act of walking was beneath him. As he comes closer you hear a deep voice say "you have been judged and found wanting..."
...and that is where we shall leave it tonight 😱

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 2:53 PM
Dumbledick you are up
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:39 PM
Dumbledick, familiar with the Turn Undead Channel Divinity as he has that ability himself, sees it is successful because of the terror in the demeanor of this new foe. Not seeking to waste any Spell slots for now, Dumbledick will simply shout out "everyone, this fiend will now run as far away from Pizza as possible and thus exit the same way as it entered unless we cause it physical harm in which case, this effect will cease and it will attack us again. We have 1 minute of this effect, so my advice is we let it run so that we can quickly continue with our barricades/engage in some other course of action. What say ye? 
While waiting for everyone's response, Dumbledick will move to the tile that is one down and 2 right of Nero with all his movement. Dumbledick will use his standard action to remain in the dodge action and end his turn 
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 4:13 PM
Ae'lun replies "I dont think barricades will work against smoke and shadows" he will then focus on the creature as best he can marking it with his hunters mark, he will then ready an arrow to shoot the creature as soon as it returns to its more solid form.
Thats my turn
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:21 PM
Dumbledick responds: "True. Now that we know our barricades are useless against this thing, we can either try and fight it still or while it is running away, we run right behind it as far as possible to a possible new location. But that is all for you to decide. But should you all choose to fight, readying an action for when this creature takes a solid form is a rather good idea that I think everyone should take from you Ae'lun. Good thinking" 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Yesterday at 4:23 PM

From your knowledge and by studying his movement during your attacks you will gather that while the ghost is in the Border Ethereal (which is another plane of existence) he is technically not there and that is why you can't touch him. You can see him, but nothing from this plane can effect him as he is not in this plane.
Ky — Yesterday at 10:35 PM
Tova will hold her action and ready her sacred flame which she will cast if the creature moves towards her. she will try and gain as much knowledge about the creature using her knowledge from years of studying the undead. Any new information could be crucial to defending themselves. 

Then that's me.

You would realize by studying the effects spells have on the creature that while in the Border Ethereal no spells would effect it... You also know that it took an action for him to move into the Border Ethereal Plane and that is why it didn't attack you earlier.
I believe after you it is Peridot and then Nero
Ky — Yesterday at 11:14 PM
Tova will once again share this information, adding that perhaps with him moving into the ethereal plane, turn undead didn't work and we should be alert and ready in case it attacks instead of running away
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:33 PM

The DM only said he failed his saving throw. He never said if it actually affected him. If magic doesn't affect this thing, perhaps he (the monster) wants us to think it did 🤔

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:32 PM
According to the last maps initative it's before tova and after Enyawd
Toombz — Today at 3:33 PM
Dumbledick will simply move to the original position he had before his movement last round which is indicated on this map (2 blocks below Peridot) and maintain the dodge action. That ends my turn 

Here's an indication of the initiative order @Deformiter (Arden)
Image
Guys I highly recommend using the dodge action if you're not gonna do anything for your turn because at least if you get attacked, whoever is attacking you will have disadvantage on their attack rolls against you (they have to roll twice and take the lower value) and you will have advantage on dexterity saving throws (you get to roll twice and take the higher value). Long story short, it makes you tougher to be hit by an opponent
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:42 PM
Ae'lun yells "what are you scared of? come out here where we can hit you!" staying ready to attack, Shnuggles will move next to Tova
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:51 PM
I guess then we are at Enyawd 🤔

As the ghost steps out of the Border Ethereal Realm and stares you right in the face, Tova you are distracted and not able to hit with your Sacred Flame...
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:52 PM
DM side note - Since we have not had this before and it is not a very widely used rule. In the official rules... When you ready an action you can only move or attack. You can move on your turn and then ready the action but you cannot hold both. Also take into account that a readied action uses your reaction to achieve the action and thus you would not have a reaction on that turn to say make an opportunity attack.

To use a readied action you must declare your trigger and effect... Trigger - When the ghost moves.
Effect - I stab it with a dagger.

The Trigger is actually considered your action and the and effect is your Reaction.

I have no problem using your readied action to move and then attack, but just giving the RAW as well. Just make sure to include it in your trigger...like if the goblin draws his blade, I move towards him and attack. 
He can do nothing else on his turn so Tova, you are up.
Toombz — Today at 7:57 PM
Oh damn.. I didn't know this I legit thought it was just a reaction but it's a whole action? 😬 I guess we have no choice in future but to remember this now but it makes things interesting
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:02 PM
What makes it even more risky is if your trigger doesn't occur say if you want to cast a spell, it still consumes your spell slot even if the trigger doesn't happen (since the spell is technically in process from the time your action is readied) you only release the spell when the trigger happens but the spell is already cast 😱

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

Arden, using the destructive power of fire to attack the ghost.. After Pizza I believe it is Dumbledick
Toombz — Today at 12:02 AM
Dumbledick decides to use his full movement to get to the tile directly below Peridot
And then, Dumbledick Casts Spiritual Weapon on the tile directly above Peridot and then attacks with it

Dumbledick casts Spiritual Weapon!
Dumbledick
Effect: Spiritual Weapon (Attack: Spiritual Weapon)
Effect
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

Your conjure your spiritual weapon and strike, but the ghost having seen this before is ready and easily blocks your attack...and then deflecting your sacred flame as if it was nothing.
That would make Au'lun and Enyawd next...🗡️

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:18 PM
Nervous farts🤣🙈
Being a turtle in this scenario makes me slightly uncomfortable 😐🙈
Toombz — Today at 1:23 PM
If Tova is available to make a move for Enyawd or Enyawd himself can, may I recommend that she move Enyawd on to the tile above her so that he and I can be in flanking position and he and I will get advantage on attack rolls in the bad guy? 🌚🤣 my dice rolls are ass so I need all the help I can get😭
Jarrod — Today at 1:47 PM
Sadly tova and peridot is already flanking
Toombz — Today at 2:03 PM
But can't Enyawd and I also flank? Is it in the rules that a creature can't be flanked twice?
Jarrod — Today at 2:05 PM
you can depends on where he moves if he wants to do a melee attack since it has resistances to piercing
Toombz — Today at 2:09 PM
True but he could try and knock it prone which would give everyone advantage on attack throws against it, even the players who are a distance away and it will have disadvantage on dex saves. Plus all damage counts hey? But that was only a suggestion
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:13 PM
Keep in mind only attacks within 5ft have advantage... ranged attacks have disadvantage (basically coz the target is smaller)
Toombz — Today at 3:15 PM
Oh okay I see. The target being smaller leading to disadvantage even when knocked prone I had no idea about. Thanks for the education 🙌

But at least more than 2 people can flank 1 opponent 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:22 PM
Let's see if the condition command works... I haven't used it 🤣
!condition prone
Avrae
BOT
 — Today at 3:22 PM

Setto Kaiba
Condition: Prone
You are prone
Description
A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
Rule | PHB 292
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:42 PM
@Setto Kaiba aren't wraiths immune to being knocked prone ...just curious 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:45 PM
That would make sense, but wierdly enough it isn't listed as a condition immunity 🤦‍♂️
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:46 PM
Huh... interesting 🤔 I don't have  my books on me since wasn't sure but my mind kept telling me it was logical 😅😅😅....
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:46 PM
It should be though... normal wraiths are immune to that so I don't know why this one isn't... I sure will change that later... but it is what it is now 🤷‍♂️
Prone and restrained actually
and grappled
Toombz — Today at 5:48 PM
Yeah and it's pointless to knock it prone if it will make it hard for the others to hit it from distance.. Unless we do this
Image
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:49 PM
So it could be grappled ...and restrained....and now I can't touch it with any spells🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️....dang it ...could have had that sucker like that😑
Curse warlocks and their short rest bs😂....
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:51 PM
I didn't think about this when I created the monster 😂 it was based of another type of wraith so I thought someone would have thought of it already, I was wrong 🤣
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:53 PM
@Setto Kaiba Lol I thought you were just taunting us giving us something almost impossible to hit by any means while we're mostly tapped for a savage yet swift tpk🙈🙈🙈🙈 
I mean I sure wouldn't see that coming 😂

@Enyawd Nightbeard  just in case you don't know cause of all the messages, it's your move but we know you've had a long and busy day and I hope it was a good one so take your time and respond when ready🙌 and for everyone whether they read this or not, hope you had a great day too

Map Update: Pizza moved to the alter, Dumbledick moved to the tile right below Peridot and conjured another Scythe above Peridot, Shnuggles "distracted the creature" but I'm not sure it involved movement, and I think that's all

Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (16) + 4 = 20
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
Bound to you and you to it. Should you die, the hammer will be destroyed...should the hammer be destroyed you will die. Whenever this warhammer is 30ft or more from you it will automatically return to your hand. When making an attack roll against any creature other than a Goblin with this weapon you must first roll 1d20, if the roll is 1-10 you automatically miss the attack and the weapon's unstable magical energies explode and causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage to you. If you roll an 11-20 you are able to control the energies and direct it as normal with no damage to you. Whenever you try to attack any creature other than a goblin with any other weapon besides this weapon, you must roll 1d20. On a 1-10 your attack automatically fails. On an 11-20 you may attack as normal.

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

As a result, the Ghost can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, so people won't take attacks of opportunity if they decide to run from the Ghost. If Dumbledick can move through the Ghost, he would like to move to where his Spiritual Weapon currently is and move his Spiritual Weapon to the tile above Tova. That will end my turn
If Dumbledick cannot move through the Ghost, then he would like to still move the spiritual weapon to the tile above Tova, but will himself move to the tile to the right of Tova

Now... for those still left standing... you need to decide what is more important, trying to kill the ghost or trying to revive your party members... for reference, his legendary action is triggered when only 1/3 of HP is left 🤔

Undead but @Setto Kaiba can confirm because he may have altered this wraith

Enyawd will alternate between saving his party and striking ghostpops (action and BA)

Sure. But right now, it's still @Setto Kaiba turn. Let's see what he has planned

You see as the ghost looks straight at Enyawd and its eyes start to glow and Enyawd you feel as this ghost is trying to push its way into your body... Please can you give me a DC13 Charisma Saving Throw as this ghost is trying to possess your body.

Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:50 PM
As the ghost looks you straight in the eyes, you feel how it pushes into your body... At first you struggle, but slowly you start losing control of your lumbs until the ghost is no more and only you are left... You are still aware of what is going on around you, but you no longer have any control over your body... you are incapacitated.

The ghost now in Enyawd's body will stay where it is 🫣

I believe Arden is next...
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 9:59 PM
Yes... but the spiritual weapon is not a melee weapon... Here is some more info 👇

Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:02 PM
No problem. Thanks for the heads up @Setto Kaiba. So only first roll counts then which is still 17 total or do you want me to roll again since I cocked up the flanking thing? 
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:08 PM
Nah... I'll stick to the first roll... which is just not enough to pierce his armor 🫣
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/21/2024 10:08 PM
Does Shnuggles get death saves or how does that work?
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:09 PM
Good question.. Cause if Shnuggles doesn't get death saves, then I'll just give his/her 1 HP to Nero
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:10 PM

If you have a spell slot you use that if not, you can only summon him again after a long rest.
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/21/2024 10:11 PM
ah okay I thought that was the case, just wanted to confirm thanks
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
Sorry @Basically_A_Chicken I guess I have to give Shnuggles 1 HP to Nero then. Everyone now has 3 HP each that was down before
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
You can give his 1HP to Nero as he is not a physical creature... he is actually a summoned spirit
Is that the turn for Dumbledick?
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
probably a better call anyway😅
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:13 PM
You'll let me know if Dumbledick's verbal tirades were enough to get the wraith to fully focus his attention then?🦾😎 
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:13 PM
Yes. Dumbledick's turn is finished 
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:14 PM
He might focus on you, but he will attack whoever is in his way since he is boxed in and wouldn't make sense to try and fly around the room to get to you.
Then I believe it is Au'lun and then Enyawd
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:17 PM
But I'm on the tile above Peridot right next to the wraith based on this map @Setto Kaiba. If I was wrong about the map, then Dumbledick would like to use his movement to get right in the face of thr wraith so that he is right next to it within 5ft

Damage: 1d6 (6) = 6
Effect
You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature.

That's a good bit of damage... not bad... As the ghost just feels the arrow flying through its body... the arrow now taking some of that "plasma" with it as it hits the ground behind the ghost.

Think its his curse weapon. If he attacks a non goblin he has to roll a D20 where 1-10 he takes the damage and 11-20 he can attack freely

That's for the info man. I appreciate it🤙
Toombz — Yesterday at 12:42 AM
After Ae'lun's attack, Dumbledick throws more verbal tirades at the wraith's way in order to keep the attention of the wraith on himself:
"Did ghosty moisty get a boo boo and now needs his pacifier because he's about to cry? Ncaawwwww there there now.." (Get it, because he's a ghost and ghosts go boo and it's a double entendre and uh... nevermind) 
Image
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 7:31 AM
As you take your Warhammer to smash this ghost, the curse takes hold and it deals 12 points of damage to you before you are able to attack...Lying there, unconscious, and not moving, the Warhammer seemingly dissolves from your hand and blows aways like smoke in a soft breeze.

The ghost will focus his gaze on Dumbledick and stretching his hand out will attempt to pull the life force from him...

Tova will slowly open her eyes and take in the sounds around her. Not sure who to thank for her still being here, she will slowly sit up and look around at the scene before her. Seeing the wraith still in action, she will get up, but she won't make an opportunity attack because she's still a little too groggy to pull her weapon out in time.

What Dumbledick would have said is "You don't deserve to Don the attire of the knight that you currently bear.

Show some pride and prove yourself honorable and worthy of the vow of knights and fight! Even till defeat, a knight should experience glorious defeat.
