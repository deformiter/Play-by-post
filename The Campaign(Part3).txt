As Arden closes his eyes for a second, and the rest of the party takes some time to bandage their wounds...Only Tova seems to sense the danger that lies and waits in the tomb...

Having spent some time barricading the door coming into the cave but not really doing much to seal up the new passage, you Tova see as billowing shadows coalesce into an opaque, smoke-like body of black, blue and green...The figure slowly drifting toward you accross the floor as if the act of walking was beneath him. As he comes closer you hear a deep voice say "you have been judged and found wanting..."
...and that is where we shall leave it tonight 😱

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 2:53 PM
Dumbledick you are up
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:39 PM
Dumbledick, familiar with the Turn Undead Channel Divinity as he has that ability himself, sees it is successful because of the terror in the demeanor of this new foe. Not seeking to waste any Spell slots for now, Dumbledick will simply shout out "everyone, this fiend will now run as far away from Pizza as possible and thus exit the same way as it entered unless we cause it physical harm in which case, this effect will cease and it will attack us again. We have 1 minute of this effect, so my advice is we let it run so that we can quickly continue with our barricades/engage in some other course of action. What say ye? 
While waiting for everyone's response, Dumbledick will move to the tile that is one down and 2 right of Nero with all his movement. Dumbledick will use his standard action to remain in the dodge action and end his turn 
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 4:13 PM
Ae'lun replies "I dont think barricades will work against smoke and shadows" he will then focus on the creature as best he can marking it with his hunters mark, he will then ready an arrow to shoot the creature as soon as it returns to its more solid form.
Thats my turn
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:21 PM
Dumbledick responds: "True. Now that we know our barricades are useless against this thing, we can either try and fight it still or while it is running away, we run right behind it as far as possible to a possible new location. But that is all for you to decide. But should you all choose to fight, readying an action for when this creature takes a solid form is a rather good idea that I think everyone should take from you Ae'lun. Good thinking" 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Yesterday at 4:23 PM

From your knowledge and by studying his movement during your attacks you will gather that while the ghost is in the Border Ethereal (which is another plane of existence) he is technically not there and that is why you can't touch him. You can see him, but nothing from this plane can effect him as he is not in this plane.
Ky — Yesterday at 10:35 PM
Tova will hold her action and ready her sacred flame which she will cast if the creature moves towards her. she will try and gain as much knowledge about the creature using her knowledge from years of studying the undead. Any new information could be crucial to defending themselves. 

Then that's me.

You would realize by studying the effects spells have on the creature that while in the Border Ethereal no spells would effect it... You also know that it took an action for him to move into the Border Ethereal Plane and that is why it didn't attack you earlier.
I believe after you it is Peridot and then Nero
Ky — Yesterday at 11:14 PM
Tova will once again share this information, adding that perhaps with him moving into the ethereal plane, turn undead didn't work and we should be alert and ready in case it attacks instead of running away
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:33 PM

The DM only said he failed his saving throw. He never said if it actually affected him. If magic doesn't affect this thing, perhaps he (the monster) wants us to think it did 🤔

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:32 PM
According to the last maps initative it's before tova and after Enyawd
Toombz — Today at 3:33 PM
Dumbledick will simply move to the original position he had before his movement last round which is indicated on this map (2 blocks below Peridot) and maintain the dodge action. That ends my turn 

Here's an indication of the initiative order @Deformiter (Arden)
Image
Guys I highly recommend using the dodge action if you're not gonna do anything for your turn because at least if you get attacked, whoever is attacking you will have disadvantage on their attack rolls against you (they have to roll twice and take the lower value) and you will have advantage on dexterity saving throws (you get to roll twice and take the higher value). Long story short, it makes you tougher to be hit by an opponent
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:42 PM
Ae'lun yells "what are you scared of? come out here where we can hit you!" staying ready to attack, Shnuggles will move next to Tova
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:51 PM
I guess then we are at Enyawd 🤔

As the ghost steps out of the Border Ethereal Realm and stares you right in the face, Tova you are distracted and not able to hit with your Sacred Flame...
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:52 PM
DM side note - Since we have not had this before and it is not a very widely used rule. In the official rules... When you ready an action you can only move or attack. You can move on your turn and then ready the action but you cannot hold both. Also take into account that a readied action uses your reaction to achieve the action and thus you would not have a reaction on that turn to say make an opportunity attack.

To use a readied action you must declare your trigger and effect... Trigger - When the ghost moves.
Effect - I stab it with a dagger.

The Trigger is actually considered your action and the and effect is your Reaction.

I have no problem using your readied action to move and then attack, but just giving the RAW as well. Just make sure to include it in your trigger...like if the goblin draws his blade, I move towards him and attack. 
He can do nothing else on his turn so Tova, you are up.
Toombz — Today at 7:57 PM
Oh damn.. I didn't know this I legit thought it was just a reaction but it's a whole action? 😬 I guess we have no choice in future but to remember this now but it makes things interesting
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:02 PM
What makes it even more risky is if your trigger doesn't occur say if you want to cast a spell, it still consumes your spell slot even if the trigger doesn't happen (since the spell is technically in process from the time your action is readied) you only release the spell when the trigger happens but the spell is already cast 😱

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

Arden, using the destructive power of fire to attack the ghost.. After Pizza I believe it is Dumbledick
Toombz — Today at 12:02 AM
Dumbledick decides to use his full movement to get to the tile directly below Peridot
And then, Dumbledick Casts Spiritual Weapon on the tile directly above Peridot and then attacks with it

Dumbledick casts Spiritual Weapon!
Dumbledick
Effect: Spiritual Weapon (Attack: Spiritual Weapon)
Effect
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

Your conjure your spiritual weapon and strike, but the ghost having seen this before is ready and easily blocks your attack...and then deflecting your sacred flame as if it was nothing.
That would make Au'lun and Enyawd next...🗡️

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:18 PM
Nervous farts🤣🙈
Being a turtle in this scenario makes me slightly uncomfortable 😐🙈
Toombz — Today at 1:23 PM
If Tova is available to make a move for Enyawd or Enyawd himself can, may I recommend that she move Enyawd on to the tile above her so that he and I can be in flanking position and he and I will get advantage on attack rolls in the bad guy? 🌚🤣 my dice rolls are ass so I need all the help I can get😭
Jarrod — Today at 1:47 PM
Sadly tova and peridot is already flanking
Toombz — Today at 2:03 PM
But can't Enyawd and I also flank? Is it in the rules that a creature can't be flanked twice?
Jarrod — Today at 2:05 PM
you can depends on where he moves if he wants to do a melee attack since it has resistances to piercing
Toombz — Today at 2:09 PM
True but he could try and knock it prone which would give everyone advantage on attack throws against it, even the players who are a distance away and it will have disadvantage on dex saves. Plus all damage counts hey? But that was only a suggestion
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:13 PM
Keep in mind only attacks within 5ft have advantage... ranged attacks have disadvantage (basically coz the target is smaller)
Toombz — Today at 3:15 PM
Oh okay I see. The target being smaller leading to disadvantage even when knocked prone I had no idea about. Thanks for the education 🙌

But at least more than 2 people can flank 1 opponent 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:22 PM
Let's see if the condition command works... I haven't used it 🤣
!condition prone
Avrae
BOT
 — Today at 3:22 PM

Setto Kaiba
Condition: Prone
You are prone
Description
A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
Rule | PHB 292
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:42 PM
@Setto Kaiba aren't wraiths immune to being knocked prone ...just curious 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:45 PM
That would make sense, but wierdly enough it isn't listed as a condition immunity 🤦‍♂️
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:46 PM
Huh... interesting 🤔 I don't have  my books on me since wasn't sure but my mind kept telling me it was logical 😅😅😅....
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:46 PM
It should be though... normal wraiths are immune to that so I don't know why this one isn't... I sure will change that later... but it is what it is now 🤷‍♂️
Prone and restrained actually
and grappled
Toombz — Today at 5:48 PM
Yeah and it's pointless to knock it prone if it will make it hard for the others to hit it from distance.. Unless we do this
Image
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:49 PM
So it could be grappled ...and restrained....and now I can't touch it with any spells🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️....dang it ...could have had that sucker like that😑
Curse warlocks and their short rest bs😂....
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:51 PM
I didn't think about this when I created the monster 😂 it was based of another type of wraith so I thought someone would have thought of it already, I was wrong 🤣
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:53 PM
@Setto Kaiba Lol I thought you were just taunting us giving us something almost impossible to hit by any means while we're mostly tapped for a savage yet swift tpk🙈🙈🙈🙈 
I mean I sure wouldn't see that coming 😂

@Enyawd Nightbeard  just in case you don't know cause of all the messages, it's your move but we know you've had a long and busy day and I hope it was a good one so take your time and respond when ready🙌 and for everyone whether they read this or not, hope you had a great day too

Map Update: Pizza moved to the alter, Dumbledick moved to the tile right below Peridot and conjured another Scythe above Peridot, Shnuggles "distracted the creature" but I'm not sure it involved movement, and I think that's all

Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (16) + 4 = 20
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
Bound to you and you to it. Should you die, the hammer will be destroyed...should the hammer be destroyed you will die. Whenever this warhammer is 30ft or more from you it will automatically return to your hand. When making an attack roll against any creature other than a Goblin with this weapon you must first roll 1d20, if the roll is 1-10 you automatically miss the attack and the weapon's unstable magical energies explode and causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage to you. If you roll an 11-20 you are able to control the energies and direct it as normal with no damage to you. Whenever you try to attack any creature other than a goblin with any other weapon besides this weapon, you must roll 1d20. On a 1-10 your attack automatically fails. On an 11-20 you may attack as normal.

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

As a result, the Ghost can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, so people won't take attacks of opportunity if they decide to run from the Ghost. If Dumbledick can move through the Ghost, he would like to move to where his Spiritual Weapon currently is and move his Spiritual Weapon to the tile above Tova. That will end my turn
If Dumbledick cannot move through the Ghost, then he would like to still move the spiritual weapon to the tile above Tova, but will himself move to the tile to the right of Tova

Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:50 PM
As the ghost looks you straight in the eyes, you feel how it pushes into your body... At first you struggle, but slowly you start losing control of your lumbs until the ghost is no more and only you are left... You are still aware of what is going on around you, but you no longer have any control over your body... you are incapacitated.

The ghost now in Enyawd's body will stay where it is 🫣

I believe Arden is next...

If you have a spell slot you use that if not, you can only summon him again after a long rest.

Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
Sorry @Basically_A_Chicken I guess I have to give Shnuggles 1 HP to Nero then. Everyone now has 3 HP each that was down before
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
You can give his 1HP to Nero as he is not a physical creature... he is actually a summoned spirit
Is that the turn for Dumbledick?

Yes. Dumbledick's turn is finished 
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:14 PM
He might focus on you, but he will attack whoever is in his way since he is boxed in and wouldn't make sense to try and fly around the room to get to you.
Then I believe it is Au'lun and then Enyawd
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:17 PM
But I'm on the tile above Peridot right next to the wraith based on this map @Setto Kaiba. If I was wrong about the map, then Dumbledick would like to use his movement to get right in the face of thr wraith so that he is right next to it within 5ft

You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry.

Toombz — Yesterday at 12:42 AM
After Ae'lun's attack, Dumbledick throws more verbal tirades at the wraith's way in order to keep the attention of the wraith on himself:
"Did ghosty moisty get a boo boo and now needs his pacifier because he's about to cry? Ncaawwwww there there now.." (Get it, because he's a ghost and ghosts go boo and it's a double entendre and uh... nevermind)

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 7:31 AM
As you take your Warhammer to smash this ghost, the curse takes hold and it deals 12 points of damage to you before you are able to attack...Lying there, unconscious, and not moving, the Warhammer seemingly dissolves from your hand and blows aways like smoke in a soft breeze.

The ghost will focus his gaze on Dumbledick and stretching his hand out will attempt to pull the life force from him...

Tova will slowly open her eyes and take in the sounds around her. Not sure who to thank for her still being here, she will slowly sit up and look around at the scene before her. Seeing the wraith still in action, she will get up, but she won't make an opportunity attack because she's still a little too groggy to pull her weapon out in time.

Arden once more calls upon the ancient and sacred energies of Zivara that course through the veins of the world. With a deep, grounding breath that draws upon the very core of his being, he summons forth a radiant flame [Produce Flame (Cantrip)]. The fire dances within his open palm. Arden thrusts the flame forward, directing it towards the heart of the wraith with all the force his spirit can muster.

To Hit: 1d20 (20) + 5 = 25
Damage (CRIT!): 2d8 (4, 1) = 5
Effect
A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Ever the battle whore: Dumbledick, standing face to face with the Wraith, is sporting a big smile on his face because epic, life & death clashes are what he lives for. He is also extremely happy that he's got the wraith's full attention especially because his allies are low on health. He recognizes the urgency to build his greatest defense possible but he first casts Sacred Flame as a Cantrip. @Setto Kaiba I need a DC 12 (I think) dexterity saving throw 
Dumbledick then says to the wraith "I admire you for the  great honour you have and must admit that your last attack nearly hit me and is one of the mightiest blows I have ever faced. I would love to see you try it again." Dumbledick hopes that these words will encourage the Wraith to further attack him and only him, not his allies and equally as important, hopes these words will encourage the wraith to stay & fight instead of run away. He then casts Shield of Faith as his Bonus action and ends his turn.

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 1:28 PM
Arden once more calls upon the ancient and sacred energies of Zivara that course through the veins of the world. With a deep, grounding breath that draws upon the very core of his being, he summons forth a radiant flame [Produce Flame (Cantrip)]. The fire dances within his open palm. Arden thrusts the flame forward, directing it towards the heart of the wraith with all the force his spirit can muster.

Arden Greenwood casts Produce Flame!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (20) + 5 = 25
Damage (CRIT!): 2d8 (4, 1) = 5
Effect
A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Ever the battle whore: Dumbledick, standing face to face with the Wraith, is sporting a big smile on his face because epic, life & death clashes are what he lives for. He is also extremely happy that he's got the wraith's full attention especially because his allies are low on health. He recognizes the urgency to build his greatest defense possible but he first casts Sacred Flame as a Cantrip. @Setto Kaiba I need a DC 12 (I think) dexterity saving throw 
Dumbledick then says to the wraith "I admire you for the  great honour you have and must admit that your last attack nearly hit me and is one of the mightiest blows I have ever faced. I would love to see you try it again." Dumbledick hopes that these words will encourage the Wraith to further attack him and only him, not his allies and equally as important, hopes these words will encourage the wraith to stay & fight instead of run away. He then casts Shield of Faith as his Bonus action and ends his turn.

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:33 PM
With the wraith's presence no longer a threat, Arden, guided by the teachings of Zivara and his deep connection to the natural world, turns his attention to the weary group. He motions to his allies, a silent beckoning back to the warmth and safety of his makeshift campfire. "Comrades, our spirits have been tested this day, and through our combined strength, we have prevailed," he begins, his voice carrying the weight of their shared ordeal yet imbued with a comforting warmth. "Let us take this moment to rest, to heal not just the wounds of the flesh but those of the soul. I will prepare a meal in honor of Zivara, that we may draw strength from the earth as we share in this bounty."

While the others settle, Arden will work and craft a new staff, weaving together branches, roots, and twigs collected from the grand tree, a physical manifestation of their resilience and unity. Each motion is a meditation, each selection a prayer, embodying the cycle of growth and renewal that defines their journey. In this act, Arden finds solace and strength, a silent vow to continue. 
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
Once the sheer adrenaline and chaos of the fight comes to pass Nero slips into his shell so fast that he is left spinning on the alter. A long rest is definitely in order 😂🙈💀
Toombz — Today at 12:38 AM
So I guess Nero, Peridot and Dumbledick are team sleep while the others are doing their own thing. 

Just a side note that a minute before the long rest officially takes place whenever that is, Dumbledick would like to use his last 2nd level spell slot to cast Aid on himself, Peridot and fellow cleric Tova. Aid is supposed to last 8 hours, but laced with 1 sorcery point, doubles the time to 16 hours. So Dumbledick, Peridot and Tova each gain 5 HP and have their HP maximum increased by 5 HP for the next 16 hours after the long rest begins officially. Dumbledick will repeat this exact spell every 16 hours 
Jarrod — Today at 12:43 AM
Peridot will just need 4 hours and will take watch from there
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:18 AM
Arden too will only require 4 hours to gain full refreshment

Burger — Today at 7:50 AM
Can I long rest?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:55 AM
Tova... Looking into the hallway you do not see much, it is dark and with your darvisiok you only see. What you so see and remember from prevuliously is a 10ft space that you can walk as normal, followed by atleast a 5ft "fake" piece of ground and covered by illusion magic to appear as normal ground and then beyound that Enyawd has scattered some loose rocks that revealed another 10ft of small jagged outcroppings of rock just large enough to stand with your feet close together. Beyond that is another room...
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:00 AM
This is indeed what the party is discussing now... who wants to take atleast 8 hours (or 4 for some) to rest up ( long rest)... How that will work, who is keeping watch, are you doing it in shifts, are you barricading the entrance to the new room after Tova has looked at it considering that a ghost just flies through it anyway, is there more ghosts or other creatures further in this cave that might attack you. Are you removing your armor (as in this game, when you wear heavy armor and sleep in it you will receive disadvantage on your attacks the next day)... all these questions you have to deal with...
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 8:38 AM
I believe shifts always work best. We can use the desks to barricade the othe passage if need be although if it's another ghost we are dead anyway lol. So let's take our chances and the first 2 of the 4hour sleepers and the 8 hour people go first leaving 1 or 2 as look out. Then when the first 4 hours pass the watchers swap with the first group of 4 hour people thud when the full 8 passes everyone is rested and there's always someone awake
I'd recommend those with 4 hours needed and heavy amour go on watch first as you can keep watch while removing surely
Ky — Today at 8:56 AM
I don't know how the elves (Peridot and Arden) would feel but in my mind it makes sense if those that need 8 hours take 8 hours and the elves switch off, that way we don't extend the period of vulnerability and everyone  gets a rest. The disadvantage to this is that there is only one person doing perception checks. Either way works, just thought I'd throw it out there
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:21 AM
Enyawd gingerly stands up... his balance is not great but he feels lighter somehow. He takes off his armor. Goblinsbane is gone, and he is not too sure what to make of that. He bows low to his party members, before collapsing into a long, 8 hour sleep 
Jarrod — Today at 9:23 AM
So what you saying is peridot and arden do shifts in keeping watch?
Toombz — Today at 9:26 AM
Yeah I feel like this is a great idea. @Deformiter (Arden) is still pretty fresh on health and you and him only need 4 hours of rest while we all need 8 hours. That way, after 8 hours are done, everyone will have gotten rest 
Toombz — Today at 9:28 AM
Yeah Dumbledick will do the same. Armour off before 8 hour slumber
Jarrod — Today at 9:41 AM
Could peridot take the first nap
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:23 AM
As you all make ready to take a long rest, some of you already having removed your armor and just enjoying your meal made by Arden, you suddenly hear a "thud" and then the sound of stone grinding against stone as a door opens behind the sarcophagus in the top right hand corner...
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 10:27 AM
So long as Arden doesn't need to defend or attack, he should be fit enough to take first watch and continue working on his staff while keeping an eye out for any potential intruders.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:35 AM
Enyawd is not fussed. We'll check it out tomorrow. First sleep
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:44 AM
Enyawd to tired to even respond, turns and continue to sleep...

As the door opens, you see a 7ft tall Orc step through the door, Warpick in hand. He steps in slowly unsure of what he will find inside and then spots the party...

Burdok stepping out into the room the door behind you slides back into place. You see a room with 6 sarcophagai and on the eastern wall is a massive tree whos roots you see in this room with a large chest set at it's foot. The chest looks unopened or perhaps just closed again.
To your right and left you see 2 hallways that has been blocked off (the west)  by the giant stone lids from the sarcophagai and the east by 2 wooden desks.
The party you see all seem spent, barely holding on to their lives... Should you attack you feel you would probably be able to take them... Especially the dwarf sleeping not even lifting his head 🤣

Perhaps all of you can share what Burdok sees when he looks at the party...
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:43 PM
Nero hearing the commotion from within his turtle shell... proceeds to whisper to his nearest companion."pssst ... Oi...what's going on out there?....if it's friendly treat it gently... if it's foe we hit and go.... and then the echo In the shell fades as he drifts off back to sleep on the alter" 
Ky — Today at 12:50 PM
Looking at Tova, you will see a short (even by Dwarf standards) and burly female dwarf with flaming red hair. Currently she is busy taking her armor off after 1 fight to many. She's bleeding and her clothes are torn, she's dirty and sweating and grumpy as all hell because everytime things calm down, new creatures appear and she has nothing left in her to fight with at this moment. Her hands are shaking and fumbling with the armor and she is dead tired. Once her armor is off, she will fall to the floor in a heap and sleep where she lands
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:53 PM
Arden, holding a plate of food prepared by his own hands, extends it towards the Orc as a gesture of peace and fellowship. "We are well aware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows of this place," Arden speaks, his voice as steady and comforting as the earth beneath them, "and though we find ourselves weary and wounded, our spirits remain unbroken. I ask if you might join me in keeping watch over my companions this night. Your presence could lend us much-needed strength and ensure the safety of those who now rest."
-
[Arden is a male Wood Elf with an autumnal palette; his long, wavy hair blends the rich browns, deep reds, and oranges of fallen leaves. His vibrant green eyes mirror the fresh foliage of the forest, and his skin has the warm, earthy hue of tree bark. He wears a cloak that mimics the forest’s own cloak of leaves, suggesting a seamless unity with nature. His overall demeanor is one of tranquility and deep spiritual connection to the natural world around him.] 
Toombz — Today at 12:58 PM
He will see Dumbledick with his shield in one hand together with a plate of food, and an eating utensil in another. With the use of his mage hand, he was able to remove his armour fairly quickly. He takes one last bite of his food, looks to the new entrant into the dungeon, and after brief thought, puts his head down and goes to sleep with his shield in hand as is his tradition
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:07 PM
Sensing he is no immediate threat Nero would like to extend a paw out of his shell and in a eco says to the new guy....pointing at the chest in the room...." see that.....no .....touchy....got it" and then goes back to bed
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 1:10 PM
Ae'lun, a ranger air genasi with long pale blue hair and one good blue eye lies on the floor petting Shnuggles, a small green frog with wings and multiple sets of eyes, its lying peacfully on Ae'lun's chest purring like a cat
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:11 PM
The orc speaks as he takes the plate of food from the ginger elf , "The name's Burdok" He sniffs the food and takes a bite hoping that it is not poisoned, after not having a solid meal for a few days already, he gobbles up what remains on his plate, and responds to the elf "I'll keep watch with you, but try anything and you and your friends will be on your way to the hells."
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:27 PM
"Hey Elf, what is your name @Deformiter (Arden), and what are you lot doing in a crypt?"
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:42 PM
"I am Arden," he begins, his voice carrying the serene confidence of the forest at dawn. We are here to aid a nearby town, who have been plagued by goblins. The King has dismissed their plight and the citizens were in need, we found the threat not only to be real but far more dangerous than we had anticipated. Our path has been fraught with danger. We have almost lost many of our allies and sadly have already lost one." He pauses, a moment of silence enveloping him like a cloak. "Among us was Patty, a young dwarf whose spirit, brave and bright, was extinguished too soon. He journeys now with Zivara, his essence woven interconnected with the weave of the world."
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:47 PM
"A pity bout patty"
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:48 PM
"Tell me about yourself Burdok?" Arden asks. "Are you familiar with the region?"
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:50 PM
"No, I'm not from here, the world is my home wherever it leads me, wherever there is blood to spill I spill it, my god demands blood and I am all too happy to be his instrument" Burdok grins
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 2:02 PM
Arden's expression shifts subtly, a ripple of unease crossing his normally serene expression as Burdok speaks of bloodshed and devotion to a god of violence. This declaration, starkly contrasting with Arden's deeply held beliefs in the sanctity of life and the interconnectedness of all beings, prompts him to try steer the conversation away from the current discorse. "The world is vast and filled with many paths," Arden remarks, seeking common ground even in the face of such divergence. "Ours is a journey not just through the lands but through the very essence of existence, learning and growing with every step. Tell me, Burdok, have you encountered any sights on your travels that have stayed with you?"
While engaged in conversation with Burdok, Arden continues to work on crafting his new staff.
=MrFarmy= — Today at 2:07 PM
"I prefer not to talk about my past, the future is what matters, destiny awaits and fate it seems has brought me here, and what a glorious destiny awaits."
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 2:19 PM
"In the Zivara Lumynar, it is said, 'Let not the shadows of yesterday darken the steps of tomorrow. For every journey beneath the sun and moon is a testament to the strength of the spirit seeking its destiny.' Your words resonate with the wisdom of the Lumynar, friend. We are all seekers in this existence, our paths intertwined by fate yet led by the choices we make. May our journey forward be guided by the understanding and the compass of our shared destinies."
Toombz — Today at 2:20 PM
@Setto Kaiba I just wanted to ask because I saw this on a video, is it true that you can cast leveled spells without expending a spell slot so long as it is cast as a ritual and has the ritual tag? (If you cast it for 10 minutes rather than the 1 action or 1 minute requirement written"?
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:23 PM
Burdock will see a dodgy looking mountain dwarf curled up, recuperating from a rough few minutes 😂. The dwarf has black hair and two braids in his beard. His armor is neatly packed besides him. You hear him whimper something about goblinsbane
Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:16 PM
If it has the ritual tag then yes, that is true. You add 10min to the casting time (so a 1min spell will take 11min and a 1 action spell will take the action and 10min).
Toombz — Today at 4:17 PM
Thanks bro. I wanna use Spell slots as sparingly and efficiently as possible so this is good new information to keep in mind

While the party takes a much needed rest, Arden, Burdok and Snuggles keeps a close eye out for any danger. Listening carefully to hear the occasional sounds of the party members snoring, but other than that nothing of note happens... Is there anything your characters would like to do on their watch?
=MrFarmy= — Today at 8:15 PM
Burdok takes his small knife from his backpack, and starts carcing at the hilt of his warpick, for some time now he has been carving a skull into the hilt, whilst doing this he recites a seemingly neverending list of names, all women.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 8:41 PM
Arden will join Burdok in some crafting work, working on his new staff, although he will occasionally keep shifting his eyes toward Burdok, wondering about his safety still.

Ae'lun needs a full rest, Shnuggles doesn't need to sleep though
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:49 PM
Arden, with a sense of fulfillment and pride, gazes upon the newly crafted and atuned Staff of the Woodlands, feeling its power pulsate gently under his fingertips, flowing with the essence of Zivara. Turning to Burdok, he places a hand on the Orc's shoulder, a gesture of camaraderie and gratitude. "Your vigilance through the night has not gone unnoticed, Burdok," Arden speaks, his voice carrying the serene timbre of the forest's whisper. With these words of thanks and well-wishing, Arden steps towards the massive, ancient tree. Here, he settles into a deep trance, embracing the elven practice of meditation that transcends mere rest. In this sacred communion with the natural world, Arden seeks not only rejuvenation but a deeper connection to the life force that binds all beings.

Enyawd rolls over in his sleep... Dreaming of burgers and pizza and burger patties made of pizza on top of pizza
And ale. Copious amounts of ale... Pizza burger Pizzas islands in a sea of ale
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:29 AM
As you all settle in for a good long rest, Peridot taking the second shift watching over the party... Your rest passes without incident.

Everybody can get the full benefit of a long rest...

After resting and healing up, bandaging wounds and having a good meal and meeting a new potential ally...what would you like to do?
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:31 AM
Enyawd wakes up, puts on his armor and groggily looks at the orc... "You been here the whole time?"
Toombz — Today at 10:49 AM
Dumbledick also awakens, dons his armour quickly with the assistance of Mage Hand, & enhances his armour with the Blessing of the Forge. With his shield in hand and seeing that the new visitor has not killed Arden overnight, has no suspicion of the new potential ally as a threat. In fact, he relates to him as a new guy in the group and introduces himself to him. "Names Dumbledick, and what's yours"? @=MrFarmy=
Dumbledick also says good morning to everyone else and that he's happy to see everyone back to good health and asks if they are keen to further explore this cave and perhaps take it over and make it our new lair/stronghold? 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:51 AM
Amazing what a few hours of rest can do hey
Enyawd asks the orc if he has any breakfast ale... "To clarify, it's like lunch and dinner ale, but a tad stronger "
=MrFarmy= — Today at 10:58 AM
Burdok glares at Dumbledick for a second or two then grunts "Names Burdok" he then turns to Enyawd, "I do not have any ale sorry, I do not take alcohol, it dulls the mind, and in these times you need a clear head"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:04 AM
Enyawd suddenly finds himself offended by the 7ft oaf... "Well then you shouldn't have to worry, there's nothing to dull"
=MrFarmy= — Today at 11:17 AM
Burdok just looks at Enyawd and does not give a response, he carries on carving on the hilt of his weapon and starts singing a tune "They gonna hang me, in the morning, before the night is done... They gonna hang me, in the morning, and I'll never see the sun..."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:22 AM
Stretching out of his shell Nero fruffles is auburn messy morning shell head and stares at the newcomer for a few minutes before turning to the group...."so I wasn't imagining it this time...huh with all the wierd dreams from last night I wasn't even sure I'd wake again..." he then looks over at the orc and introduces himself. "Hidyho big boi  the names Nero Eberloch and i be the senior resident scorcer ...glad to see you have something between those ears and headed my warning after all.....good" he crosses his legs on the alter and takes out a ration to munch on while he processes the previous battle. 
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 11:25 AM
Burdok responds to Nero "What I need is would not be in that chest, so why waste time looking inside"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:30 AM
"Either way I wouldn't  have cared I suppose...just being polite". Stay on our goodside and you're welcome to join our escapade of eradicating this goblin plight in the land( he leans forward and deadeyes Burdok)....but mark my words laddy.....one incaling of betrayal or anything of that nature and we'll use that very weapon you're playing wit as a dental aid and then burry you with it one in the same. Are we clear here?"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:32 AM
Considering there's no breakfast ale, Enyawd suggests asking the Orc dude if there is a way around the hole through the secret door he used
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 11:34 AM
Burdok gives a short laugh, "Many have tried, and many have died trying, but I mean you no harm unless you give me reason to."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:38 AM
Nero grins at his response and while scoping the room at the rest he mutters" yeah we've heard that line before...you may have fought in many battles ....but we cleanse realms im not buying the tough guy act"
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:39 AM
Arden greets the new day with a serene composure. Standing amidst his companions, his presence a calming balm, he offers a greeting as warm as the morning sun. "Good morning to all," he begins, his voice carrying the tranquility of a still forest. "As Zivara teaches us, 'With each sunrise, we are given a chance for renewal, an invitation to weave new tales into life.' Let us embrace this day not just as survivors of the night's shadows, but as architects of our fate, united in purpose and spirit."
Ky — Today at 11:43 AM
Tova will wake up, stretch her body slowly, feeling bit by bit if everything is still working 🤣 then she will do her morning prayer ritual and put her armor back on while she sliently watches the new guy and the party members size each other up. She thanks Peridot and Arden for keeping a watch during the night. She thanks Mr snuggles too. She will pull out some rations and chew on the dried and lathered something
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:45 AM
Does the United purpose of druid craft produce the spirit of morning caffeine beans?😅😅😅
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:55 AM
Arden contemplates the request for the essence of morning's wakefulness. With a thought, he summons the magic of Druidcraft, coaxing the earth to yield the cherried bounty of Coffea arabica, each bean a vessel of invigorating promise. With care, he gathers the harvest, and with a flicker of Produce Flame, kindles a fire that crackles with life's fervor. The beans, cast into a makeshift roaster, begin their transformation, their aroma a testament to the druid's mastery over the elements. This act, a simple yet profound offering, is Arden's way of nurturing the bond among the weary souls gathered around the fire. As the coffee brews, its rich scent weaving through the air, Arden reflects on the unity fostered by shared moments of solace, a silent ode to the interconnectedness of all life, as taught by Zivara.
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 11:56 AM
Burdok who has never had coffee before "What is that, it smells good" 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:58 AM
"Coffee," Arden explains with a smile as gentle as the morning sun, "is a brew that awakens the spirit and sharpens the mind, much like the first light of dawn dispels the shadows of night."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:58 AM
Nero drifts over to Arden and responds to the orc....the essence of energy and life itself. Gives you the power of 10 warriors. Good stuff he exclaims while patiently waiting for the brew to ready."
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:59 AM
[ Ok, now I actually need to go make coffee, brb 😄 ]
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 12:01 PM
Burdok is intrigued "Does it contain alcohol?" 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:12 PM
That would be an "Irish fey cream" Nero remarks....used to be mothers favorite....but being a arcane dragon Priestess in the afterlife I suppose she has no further use of it.
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 12:14 PM
"Any chance I could try some? Without alcohol of course, It tingles senses that I have not known I had"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 12:22 PM
Enyawd, tired of the teetotalers, heads off towards to secret passageway to explore... considering the stench coming from it - he can only assume the orc was down here for some time. He carefully watches his step to not get his boots soiled as he explores the passage beyond
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:27 PM
Arden turns towards the towering figure of Burdok, "Of course, you are welcome to share with us, we have little to offer, but thank you for your watchful eye last evening,". Then, casting a vigilant glance towards Enyawd's retreating form, Arden raises his voice, ensuring it carries through the dimly lit space, "Enyawd, venture not too far alone into the shadows. The unknown here is vast and filled with perils we have yet to uncover."
Ky — Today at 12:38 PM
Quick question, who is the most dexterous among us and who is the strongest/biggest? Tova's strength is not bad but she's small.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:49 PM
Strength - Pizza with 19+4
Dex - Peridot with 20+5
Biggest (height) probably Burdok with 7ft ( not sure on others heights as sheets dont have details 😄 )
Toombz — Today at 1:03 PM
@Ky @Jarrod don't forget to add +5 to your HP because for the next 8 hours you have my Aid spell boosting your HP maximum. In 8 hours, I'm gonna cast Aid again. Once I level up, this benefit will become +10 when I use a 3rd level slot
Jarrod — Today at 1:04 PM
gotcha thanks
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:17 PM
is that for everyone? or just them?
Toombz — Today at 1:20 PM
It's just for them and myself unfortunately. I can only target 3 creatures with it. I can cast it twice again so it covers everyone but it will burn too many spell slots so I wanna only cast it once a day and if i have any slots leftover at night, cast it again. I choose @Jarrod because he's a damage beast and @Ky because she's the resident healer if anyone is dying so they need to be as durable as possible. 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:22 PM
No worries 🙂

Ky — Today at 2:12 PM

A standard desk is 1.2m, 5ft is 1.52m. It won't fit 🤔 I thought Peridot could see what is that side. We might not need to all go across

i mean i can just leap over the hole as far as we know its only 5 feat
Toombz — Today at 3:33 PM
If this is correct, then to leap over the 5ft hole, you need your strength modifier to be +2 or more. Is it? 

And anyone else have a strength modifier of +2 or more so they could also jump over? @Setto Kaiba is this source legit?
Image
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:37 PM
I think this would be a long jump
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:39 PM
Looking into the hallway it is just over 30ft long and 5ft wide. The first 10ft you know to be solid ground. Then there is a 5ft gap that appears like normal ground but it falls away into a cavern below as far as you can see. Then beyond that is another 15ft that appears to be normal ground, but the little stones that Enyawd threw to there revealed small outcroppings of rock in the middle that you need to cross  to get to the room (so that last more or less 15ft is not solid ground it is little outcroppings like stalagmites). Beyond that is a room. You currently have no idea what is in that room. 

These are all things you discovered before...when you had light there.
Toombz — Today at 3:41 PM
Then I suppose everyone can jump over, even me who has a strength score of 8🤣🤣

Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:47 PM

Toombz — Today at 3:51 PM
So who wants to be the first to try and jump? Then they can use a sword/staff or whatever to test and see if there is solid ground before they continue walking forward
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:55 PM
Enyawd will pick up some stones and go hopping... Much like a game his niece used to play... Is snuggles a flying glow frog? 
Ky — Today at 4:08 PM
You just need to hope we all roll well 🤣
Tova will cast light on Shnuggles
Jarrod — Today at 4:14 PM
peridot being dexi will jump across and then be very careful to see if any other holes are in place
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 4:16 PM
Peridot should take the handful of stones, and tie the rope around him well ... the 7ft oaf can be tied to the other end of the rope - just in case
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:18 PM
Shnuggles will freak out slightly as he starts glowing, Ae'lun will scratch the top of his head "don't worry buddy you're not going to explode. Do me a favor and keep an eye or six over our friend Peri over there" Shnuggles will float above lighting his way
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 4:38 PM
So for clarity, those last 15ft arnt solid ground, but the tips of stalagmites? Were they tested with the rocks to ensure they're solid?

Arden would throw a small pebble on the ground that we know is an illusion to see if they fall through - this will provide enough information to know that the perceived futher solid ground is not also an illusion that has a weight limit before the illusion fails.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:06 PM
Yes...  so for 5ft there is nothing. Then for another 15ft that you know of there is a stalagmite or two to jump on. The tricky part is that it all looks like real floor. One or two of the small stones are staying on the floor while the rest fell through the floor and into the abyss. Just by looking at the floor you don't know what is real and what is not and where exactly the stalagmites are 🤔... Beyond into the room you have no idea what awaits...
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 5:09 PM
lol, wait, so on the same piece of floor, some rocks are staying while others fall through? and that's on the floor that we know is an illusion?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:11 PM
Snuggles can't talk... but he has an intel of 8... so he is about like this 👇
Image
Yes... all the rocks fall through on the first 5ft so there is nothing to stand on... one or two little rocks remain in place while the rest fell through on the remaining 15ft...
It is not just jumping... it is first figuring out where to jump before you can jump 😅
Toombz — Today at 5:23 PM
@Setto Kaiba then I will constantly cast Mage Hand in order to accurately map out where the solid ground is. Can I do that? Mage Hand works up to 30 ft 
Image
I will use the hand to press against the ground and if it goes through the ground, we can be certain there is no solid surface but if it can press, we know where to land
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 5:41 PM
So if I used speak with animals he could actually be an okay scout?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:43 PM
Yeah I'd say so...It won't be able to say like what is ahead, but simple things like id their humans, are their living things etc.
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 5:43 PM
Cool thank you
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:45 PM
That would potentially work... however you would have to plan exactly as when it is by solid ground it might have to stay there to ensure you know where to jump to as when it moves you cannot tell again.
Toombz — Today at 5:48 PM
Good enough for me🙌 @Jarrod we have the rope, @Burger is willing to tie it around you and himself so he can pull you up in case you fall and I can use my mage hand to show you where to land. Are you ready to jump?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:50 PM
If you have snuggles lighting the way, the mage hand guiding you and the rope I will give you advantage on the Acrobatics Check to see if you can make the jump. We will set the DC:16 as it is fairly challenging.

You manage to hold onto the outcrop. A weird sensation as you see the floor yet you also see the deep abyss below... You manage to pull yourself up, balancing carefully on this narrow piece of stalagmite... Please give me another dex check at advantage...

@Setto Kaiba my mage hand only has a range of 30ft😅 just a heads up
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:31 PM
You jump from the outcrop and narrowly misses the opposite ledge as you touch the ledge but is just not able to hold onto it as you drop down...dangling at the end of the rope.
Who is holding on to the rope?
Toombz — Today at 6:34 PM
@Burger has the rope tied to his waist
And i guess we could all be holding onto him too for s strong base

Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:42 PM
Peridot, as you dangle at the end of the rope... the rope slipping slightly as your companions above try to pull you back, you see something perhaps 40ft below (so 10ft below you) it might just be the light from Snuggles plying tricks, but it seems like a cave opening...

CON Save: 1d20 (9) + 5 = 14; Success!
Effect
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

Dumbledick weighs 200 lbs. Let's say you already dropped him off on the last tile we saw @Jarrod on. So you have more space to go get more people. Maybe we can say you dropped off the Dwarfs too?

Arden, ever resourceful and attuned to the natural magics that course through him, chooses a path less conventional, he silently invokes the spell of Spider Climb upon himself.
Toombz — Yesterday at 8:25 PM
I'm pretty sure you can carry one person hey?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 8:28 PM
Arden has 10 strength
and Spider Climb doesnt turn him into a spider, it just lets him walk on walls and ceilings 🙂
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 8:31 PM
Well carry capacity is 30x your strenght ...
you move at half movement though
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 8:36 PM
Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.
a lot more than half 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 8:37 PM
There is not enough space for people to float and Peridot to make the jump... so since Peridot took first action to move accross he will get there first... Standing at the "edge" looking into the new room you see behind you Dumbledick floating on Nero's back coming accross the false floor. As Dumbledick gets off Nero, the two of you stand there peering into the room, with Snuggles behind in the hallway providing light for the other party members.

Peridot, please give me a perception check at disadvantage or if you ask Au'lun to insteuct Snuggles to float into the room it will be a straight check.

Dumbledick, please give me a Strength Check to get Nero back to the start.
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 8:38 PM
Also will likely require a str check mid-carry and I have +0 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 8:38 PM

Dumbledick... you push Nero back to the other side... he speeds off and then slowly reaches the starting point... Who is going next on the shell ride?

Peridot, looking into this room you see a 30ft wide by 50ft long room. On the walls you see more carvings and depictions of the battleas you saw in the previous room. On th far side (Eastern Side - you are entering from the South West) you see a large stone statue, it looks like a replica of the ghost you encountered earlier. Infront of this you also see a sarcophagus, the lid partly open. Both the Sarcophagus and the statue is slightly elevated from the rest of the room about 4 steps to get to them.

The rest of the room you see 8 chests standing 4 to the North and 4 to the South, arranged in a neat line.

Dumbledick, after you push Nero you can step in as well seeing the same.

Arden, you cast your spell and then gently start walking up the side of the wall as if it was flat ground. You walk up and then walk upside-down 30ft above the hallway until you also reach the room at the end. Looking in, you too see this.
Toombz — Yesterday at 9:17 PM

In my mind it's 50ft to the wall ahead of us. So if we use the left rectangle, we either enter the room from the top or bottom

If we use the right rectangle, we either enter the room from the left or right. But @Setto Kaiba will confirm. While we wait, maybe you can plot out both maps just in case unless it's too much work, then let's wait for DM

And don't just open. It may be trapped...or if dm is trying the funny approach they may all be dam mimics. Let's be smart here...just incase
Being cautious of the previous chest @Setto Kaiba can Nero investigate the room to see if the chests are trapped from our viewpoint 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:15 PM
I go away for 5min 😂 Ok... Let me see...

Yes, the map seems correct in specifications.

Nero, your levitate will be a little short on time... as you float in you can fee the effects starting to wear off as yoy gently float to the ground.

Arden, you can easily continue your walk on the wall and up onto the ceiling...hanging upside-down in the center of the room.

Au'lun... with your Investigation Check... as you walk around the room, just looking at everything and not touching anything, you see an inscription carved on the tomb "He who is willing to sacrifice will gain great rewards".

Tova, the pictures in this room is very similar to the pictures in the other room. They depict a battle between the knights and the goblins... in this image you see a knight killing the goblins and some goblins running away.

Depending on what information you are looking for, the rest of you can either make an Investigation Check or a Perception Check or an Arcana Check...
Toombz — Today at 1:30 PM
Hearing the terrified voice of Nero, Dumbledick will refrain from opening the chests because he agrees that they may be trapped and will invite Nero to investigate if the northern chests are trapped while he checks the southern chests. @Setto Kaiba can we only do 1 investigation check per chest? Or 1 check covers all the chests?

Tova will answer Ae'lun 'perhaps 🤔'.

Then she will move over to the chest to see if she can pick up anything, maybe something she recalls from the books
Toombz — Today at 2:06 PM
To Dumbledick this still seems like Nero is terrified because he himself was WORRIED about the chests having a touch trap activation like the previous one hence the desire to not use his own hand. So hearing Nero say he shouldn't even touch with the mage hand leads him to conclude he is "more than worried" hence he believes the word terrified is appropriate 🤣 but hey, Dumbledick ultimately agrees that it's better to be safe or extra extra safe than sorry or extra extra sorry
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:09 PM
I believe so seeing as the ritual didn't do anything physical when performed perhaps it merely opened the way to this room. We gave a sacrifice and this is our reward?
Toombz — Today at 2:11 PM
Different character personalities makes the game more fun anyways hence why the introduction of @Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy is so invigorating 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:15 PM
Call it what you like but Nero has no fear of death he has danced with it many a time...however ones silly actions could have follow on consequences or destroy critical info that we would get if we are careful...heck opening a chest set of a bunch of traps that could potentially put the entire party at risk and we don't want to have a repeat of the last room thinking we had won only for an unexpected second threat following as a result of the first.... get it? I'd rather be "terrified" and live to get out of here but Nero speaks for himself in this regard.
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 2:17 PM
Burdok upon hearing what Ae'lun has said after reading the inscription decides that all this cloak and dagger sneaky sneaky nonsense is taking too long, he grabs his small knife from his backpack, approaches the statue hoping he doesn't trigger any traps and starts checking out the statue.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:21 PM
@Setto Kaiba  can Nero first investigate the closest chest on the southern side  before trying to use mage hand to open it
Toombz — Today at 2:23 PM
I'm not sure if this is a perception or investigation check, but maybe investigation check?
Toombz — Today at 2:27 PM
Dumbledick nods approvingly and doesn't believe Burdock is terrified but seeing him also walking in a cautious manner leads him to believe he may be worried about traps like himself but also has a hint of impatience 🤣🤣
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:31 PM
One Investigation Check for all... just to speed things along... However you can try and use another type of check on another chest should you wish. Like an Investigation on one and an Arcan on the other etc.

Dumbledick and Nero... Looking at the chests you notice that they seem slightly off... Nero, you notice that there is a sense of illusion magic at work on all these chests.

Peridot, similar to the others... you notice the carvings and and depictions on the walls, the statue and the sarcophagus with the inscriptions and the chests that seem slightly weird.

Burdok, you walk up to the statue looking at it... It does not seem to have any markings on it except gor normal wear from time. It does not seem to be magical or have any defined characteristics beside being just a statue.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:39 PM
Hmm I bet atleast 1 is a mimic.... I tell the others....looks like my "terrifiedness" was warranted after all....it appears these chests are enveloped in illusion magic just like the previous one....so I say again....please be careful...."
@Setto Kaiba you say the chests have wierd inscriptions on them....can any of us determine what they say?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 2:58 PM
"Hmm illusion magic and sacrifice, could the chests thirst for blood too?"
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 3:01 PM
Think you may be onto something there.... those with mage hand can carry over some blood and test it out just incase there's second step other than the blood to opening it.
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 3:03 PM

Peridot, you are able to read the inscriptions, each chest seems to have the same, a spell of some sort... Yet they do not make much sense out of context... 

Arden, hearing Peridot read the inscriptions you recognize some elements of this... The chests have some sort of illusion magic cast upon it, yet you also detect a hint of another kind of magic...The chests seem to all be linked. You would know that the magic itself is harmless, it creates more of a puzzle to solve than a harmful effect.

I suppose that one could work I was going to try the one closest to me. But perhaps the one at the center may be a better guess...maby dumble can follow suit and we can try both as he says
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 3:37 PM
You have to mr😑.... it says sacrifice not death😂🙈
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:37 PM
True.. There is an important distinction🤣🤣 
Hearing Nero talk about sacrifice, Dumbledick looks at Ae'lun, then at Shnuggles and has a look of deep thought on his face but keeps his thoughts to himself 
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:46 PM
@Setto Kaiba we go for both. Nero for the chests and Dumbledick for the Sarcophagus
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 3:58 PM
Dumbledick you cut your hand causing some blood to fall on the sarcophagus... then after waiting a few seconds nothing happens.

Nero, you do the same... with your blood falling on the chest. As it does so, you see a blood stain appear on all the chests and for a second the illusion seems to fade and thr chests seems to shift more towards reality than illusion.
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:01 PM
@Turtlebaff420 I guess either we need you to pour more of your blood till you pass out or more of our brethren here (and sistren if that's a word) may have to volunteer before you end up a full sacrifice. Either way let's see what these illusionary chests are hiding
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 4:06 PM
Arden would suggest that perhaps we need someone sacrificing blood at each of the chests.
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 4:14 PM
"It's worth a try" Ae'lun walks towards a chest while drawing his dagger
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:16 PM
Agreed. So the 4 of us will each take a chest and 2 more volunteers maybe? If not, 2 of us may need to take 2 chests each🤣🤣

Toombz — Yesterday at 4:33 PM
Is Burdok in or is the big bad Orc scared of alcohol and losing blood?🤣🤣🤣
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 4:34 PM
Burdok is ALL about blood...
Burdok, seeing what the others are doing, murmers a few ritualistic words in his own language, and makes a cut in his left hand, with his right index and middle fingers he pushes into the cut, which covers his fingers with blood, and then proceeds to draw a line from the center of his forehead downward between his eyes and over his nose. He then sucks the blood off his fingers and lets out a devilish laugh. "Muaaaaghaghaghaghagha" blood and saliva drooling from his mouth. 
Ky — Yesterday at 4:50 PM

Tova will take a chest and offer up blood

Toombz — Yesterday at 4:56 PM
I think 7 of us have offered so far.. We need an 8th but Nero has offered to give enough for 2 if we're not able to get an 8th
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 4:58 PM
Burdok seeing that there is still not enough blood being spilt takes out his knife again, and chops off his left ear! Blood spraying all over the place, he just laughs in utter ecstasy.

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 5:39 PM
Standing next to your chest, each of you offer up a little blood... a sacrifice to obtain the reward... you see your blood drip onto the chest. Each drop of blood appearing on your chest as well as all the others...For a second it appears as if nothing has changed, untill suddenly you see the chests starting to glow... a faint aura at first but growing in intensity. As you all kinda step back and cover your eyes you see Burdok glowing in a similar fashion and then explode in a radiance of pure white light... 

As you open your eyes, and realize that Burdok is no more... you each see an item infront of you...

and that is where we shall leave it tonight as I have some work to attend to so we shall find out what you each find tomorrow...

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 2:24 PM
Arden steps forth to the spot once occupied by Burdok. His movements are deliberate. With a voice imbued with the serene strength of the forest, he recites from the Lumynar, "In the cycle of life, each end is but a new beginning. May the energies that once danced within you, Burdok, find their path back to Zivara, weaving into it strength, wisdom, and the promise of renewal." The words seem to momentarily stir the air, as if the very essence of life itself acknowledges the truth within them.

Listening to Arden's words, yet also not particularly saddened as you never really got to know Burdok, you all stand there looking down to the chest at your side...

Au'lun... you find 2 x Daggers, the blades forged by master craftsmen.    (They are +1 daggers)

Arden... you find 2 x vials with a shimmering red liquid in them. (They are Potions of Greater healing)

Dumbledick... you find a sword, made of a fine metal, with a split at the end of the balde creating a "2 prong fork". The hilt has 4 gemstones set into it and is wrapped with fine red leather strap.  (It is a Sword of Life Stealing - shortsword)

Enyawd... You find a pair of boots, crafted from the finest leather, adorned with elven symbols (These are Boots of Elven Kind)

Nero... You find a shield, shaped similar to your shell but made from dragon scales (This is a +1 shield)

Tova... You find a golden ring with a red stone set into the top and lined with smaller white stones (This is a Ring of Spell Storing)

Peridot... You find a finely crafter wooden quarterstaff. Wrapped with leather straps to increase grip. At the tips, 3 iron rings on either side increases the damage dealt to foes (This is a +1 Quarterstaff)

Pizza... You find a mace, the head with the shape of a skull at the end and the hilt wrapped in a blue leather strap (This is a mace of terror)
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:58 PM
Peridot... Having not been near the chest, you find this upon the sarcophagus that you were standing close to.
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:00 PM

Nero dons his new leathery shield covered in Draconic spikes. He remarks on its craftsmanship...." Ay like to see those gobbos hit me now.... burdock you were one crazy guy but this be a nice farewell present you left here. Cheers lad. 
Nero notices the door sliding and immediately raises his new shield
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:10 PM
Dumbledick, as a Forge Domain Cleric, is very pleased with the craftsmanship of his sword and so will sheath it. Upon hearing the door open he looks to it and assumes the dodge action ready for a potential battle
He suspects it may be Burdok teleported into the room next to their current location

Standing ready, Nero and Dumbledick... you feel a fresh mountain breeze coming from beyond and the smell of freshly cooked meat immediately draws your attention.

The doorway is closer than Tova would like to get to the unknown situation. She will however, offer to light Nero's shield or weapons or anything else he thinks will be help... On the safe side of the doorway

Pizza, walks up to Nero and Dumbledick and with a firm conviction says, "I sense evil beyond this doorway" as he lights a torch and draws his longsword. He cautiously walks up to the doorway, inspecting the arch for any symbols or traps and then slowly edges forward.

As you watch him slowly making his way to the end of the hallway, he says loudly and with a sense of hope and relief... "there is light, a way out, into the forest it would seem".

Just as he turns, you see a massive giant spider decend upon him, sinking it's fangs dripping with poison into his flesh and then quickly retreating with his limp body  in tow...
