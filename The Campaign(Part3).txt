As Arden closes his eyes for a second, and the rest of the party takes some time to bandage their wounds...Only Tova seems to sense the danger that lies and waits in the tomb...

Having spent some time barricading the door coming into the cave but not really doing much to seal up the new passage, you Tova see as billowing shadows coalesce into an opaque, smoke-like body of black, blue and green...The figure slowly drifting toward you accross the floor as if the act of walking was beneath him. As he comes closer you hear a deep voice say "you have been judged and found wanting..."
...and that is where we shall leave it tonight 😱

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 2:53 PM
Dumbledick you are up
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:39 PM
Dumbledick, familiar with the Turn Undead Channel Divinity as he has that ability himself, sees it is successful because of the terror in the demeanor of this new foe. Not seeking to waste any Spell slots for now, Dumbledick will simply shout out "everyone, this fiend will now run as far away from Pizza as possible and thus exit the same way as it entered unless we cause it physical harm in which case, this effect will cease and it will attack us again. We have 1 minute of this effect, so my advice is we let it run so that we can quickly continue with our barricades/engage in some other course of action. What say ye? 
While waiting for everyone's response, Dumbledick will move to the tile that is one down and 2 right of Nero with all his movement. Dumbledick will use his standard action to remain in the dodge action and end his turn 
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 4:13 PM
Ae'lun replies "I dont think barricades will work against smoke and shadows" he will then focus on the creature as best he can marking it with his hunters mark, he will then ready an arrow to shoot the creature as soon as it returns to its more solid form.
Thats my turn
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:21 PM
Dumbledick responds: "True. Now that we know our barricades are useless against this thing, we can either try and fight it still or while it is running away, we run right behind it as far as possible to a possible new location. But that is all for you to decide. But should you all choose to fight, readying an action for when this creature takes a solid form is a rather good idea that I think everyone should take from you Ae'lun. Good thinking" 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Yesterday at 4:23 PM

From your knowledge and by studying his movement during your attacks you will gather that while the ghost is in the Border Ethereal (which is another plane of existence) he is technically not there and that is why you can't touch him. You can see him, but nothing from this plane can effect him as he is not in this plane.
Ky — Yesterday at 10:35 PM
Tova will hold her action and ready her sacred flame which she will cast if the creature moves towards her. she will try and gain as much knowledge about the creature using her knowledge from years of studying the undead. Any new information could be crucial to defending themselves. 

Then that's me.

You would realize by studying the effects spells have on the creature that while in the Border Ethereal no spells would effect it... You also know that it took an action for him to move into the Border Ethereal Plane and that is why it didn't attack you earlier.
I believe after you it is Peridot and then Nero
Ky — Yesterday at 11:14 PM
Tova will once again share this information, adding that perhaps with him moving into the ethereal plane, turn undead didn't work and we should be alert and ready in case it attacks instead of running away
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:33 PM

The DM only said he failed his saving throw. He never said if it actually affected him. If magic doesn't affect this thing, perhaps he (the monster) wants us to think it did 🤔

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:32 PM
According to the last maps initative it's before tova and after Enyawd
Toombz — Today at 3:33 PM
Dumbledick will simply move to the original position he had before his movement last round which is indicated on this map (2 blocks below Peridot) and maintain the dodge action. That ends my turn 

Here's an indication of the initiative order @Deformiter (Arden)
Image
Guys I highly recommend using the dodge action if you're not gonna do anything for your turn because at least if you get attacked, whoever is attacking you will have disadvantage on their attack rolls against you (they have to roll twice and take the lower value) and you will have advantage on dexterity saving throws (you get to roll twice and take the higher value). Long story short, it makes you tougher to be hit by an opponent
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:42 PM
Ae'lun yells "what are you scared of? come out here where we can hit you!" staying ready to attack, Shnuggles will move next to Tova
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:51 PM
I guess then we are at Enyawd 🤔

As the ghost steps out of the Border Ethereal Realm and stares you right in the face, Tova you are distracted and not able to hit with your Sacred Flame...
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:52 PM
DM side note - Since we have not had this before and it is not a very widely used rule. In the official rules... When you ready an action you can only move or attack. You can move on your turn and then ready the action but you cannot hold both. Also take into account that a readied action uses your reaction to achieve the action and thus you would not have a reaction on that turn to say make an opportunity attack.

To use a readied action you must declare your trigger and effect... Trigger - When the ghost moves.
Effect - I stab it with a dagger.

The Trigger is actually considered your action and the and effect is your Reaction.

I have no problem using your readied action to move and then attack, but just giving the RAW as well. Just make sure to include it in your trigger...like if the goblin draws his blade, I move towards him and attack. 
He can do nothing else on his turn so Tova, you are up.
Toombz — Today at 7:57 PM
Oh damn.. I didn't know this I legit thought it was just a reaction but it's a whole action? 😬 I guess we have no choice in future but to remember this now but it makes things interesting
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:02 PM
What makes it even more risky is if your trigger doesn't occur say if you want to cast a spell, it still consumes your spell slot even if the trigger doesn't happen (since the spell is technically in process from the time your action is readied) you only release the spell when the trigger happens but the spell is already cast 😱

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

Arden, using the destructive power of fire to attack the ghost.. After Pizza I believe it is Dumbledick
Toombz — Today at 12:02 AM
Dumbledick decides to use his full movement to get to the tile directly below Peridot
And then, Dumbledick Casts Spiritual Weapon on the tile directly above Peridot and then attacks with it

Dumbledick casts Spiritual Weapon!
Dumbledick
Effect: Spiritual Weapon (Attack: Spiritual Weapon)
Effect
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

Your conjure your spiritual weapon and strike, but the ghost having seen this before is ready and easily blocks your attack...and then deflecting your sacred flame as if it was nothing.
That would make Au'lun and Enyawd next...🗡️

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:18 PM
Nervous farts🤣🙈
Being a turtle in this scenario makes me slightly uncomfortable 😐🙈
Toombz — Today at 1:23 PM
If Tova is available to make a move for Enyawd or Enyawd himself can, may I recommend that she move Enyawd on to the tile above her so that he and I can be in flanking position and he and I will get advantage on attack rolls in the bad guy? 🌚🤣 my dice rolls are ass so I need all the help I can get😭
Jarrod — Today at 1:47 PM
Sadly tova and peridot is already flanking
Toombz — Today at 2:03 PM
But can't Enyawd and I also flank? Is it in the rules that a creature can't be flanked twice?
Jarrod — Today at 2:05 PM
you can depends on where he moves if he wants to do a melee attack since it has resistances to piercing
Toombz — Today at 2:09 PM
True but he could try and knock it prone which would give everyone advantage on attack throws against it, even the players who are a distance away and it will have disadvantage on dex saves. Plus all damage counts hey? But that was only a suggestion
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:13 PM
Keep in mind only attacks within 5ft have advantage... ranged attacks have disadvantage (basically coz the target is smaller)
Toombz — Today at 3:15 PM
Oh okay I see. The target being smaller leading to disadvantage even when knocked prone I had no idea about. Thanks for the education 🙌

But at least more than 2 people can flank 1 opponent 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:22 PM
Let's see if the condition command works... I haven't used it 🤣
!condition prone
Avrae
BOT
 — Today at 3:22 PM

Setto Kaiba
Condition: Prone
You are prone
Description
A prone creature's only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
Rule | PHB 292
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:42 PM
@Setto Kaiba aren't wraiths immune to being knocked prone ...just curious 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:45 PM
That would make sense, but wierdly enough it isn't listed as a condition immunity 🤦‍♂️
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:46 PM
Huh... interesting 🤔 I don't have  my books on me since wasn't sure but my mind kept telling me it was logical 😅😅😅....
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:46 PM
It should be though... normal wraiths are immune to that so I don't know why this one isn't... I sure will change that later... but it is what it is now 🤷‍♂️
Prone and restrained actually
and grappled
Toombz — Today at 5:48 PM
Yeah and it's pointless to knock it prone if it will make it hard for the others to hit it from distance.. Unless we do this
Image
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:49 PM
So it could be grappled ...and restrained....and now I can't touch it with any spells🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️....dang it ...could have had that sucker like that😑
Curse warlocks and their short rest bs😂....
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:51 PM
I didn't think about this when I created the monster 😂 it was based of another type of wraith so I thought someone would have thought of it already, I was wrong 🤣
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:53 PM
@Setto Kaiba Lol I thought you were just taunting us giving us something almost impossible to hit by any means while we're mostly tapped for a savage yet swift tpk🙈🙈🙈🙈 
I mean I sure wouldn't see that coming 😂

@Enyawd Nightbeard  just in case you don't know cause of all the messages, it's your move but we know you've had a long and busy day and I hope it was a good one so take your time and respond when ready🙌 and for everyone whether they read this or not, hope you had a great day too

Map Update: Pizza moved to the alter, Dumbledick moved to the tile right below Peridot and conjured another Scythe above Peridot, Shnuggles "distracted the creature" but I'm not sure it involved movement, and I think that's all

Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (16) + 4 = 20
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
Bound to you and you to it. Should you die, the hammer will be destroyed...should the hammer be destroyed you will die. Whenever this warhammer is 30ft or more from you it will automatically return to your hand. When making an attack roll against any creature other than a Goblin with this weapon you must first roll 1d20, if the roll is 1-10 you automatically miss the attack and the weapon's unstable magical energies explode and causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage to you. If you roll an 11-20 you are able to control the energies and direct it as normal with no damage to you. Whenever you try to attack any creature other than a goblin with any other weapon besides this weapon, you must roll 1d20. On a 1-10 your attack automatically fails. On an 11-20 you may attack as normal.

A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

As a result, the Ghost can't take reactions until the start of its next turn, so people won't take attacks of opportunity if they decide to run from the Ghost. If Dumbledick can move through the Ghost, he would like to move to where his Spiritual Weapon currently is and move his Spiritual Weapon to the tile above Tova. That will end my turn
If Dumbledick cannot move through the Ghost, then he would like to still move the spiritual weapon to the tile above Tova, but will himself move to the tile to the right of Tova

Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:50 PM
As the ghost looks you straight in the eyes, you feel how it pushes into your body... At first you struggle, but slowly you start losing control of your lumbs until the ghost is no more and only you are left... You are still aware of what is going on around you, but you no longer have any control over your body... you are incapacitated.

The ghost now in Enyawd's body will stay where it is 🫣

I believe Arden is next...

If you have a spell slot you use that if not, you can only summon him again after a long rest.

Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
Sorry @Basically_A_Chicken I guess I have to give Shnuggles 1 HP to Nero then. Everyone now has 3 HP each that was down before
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:12 PM
You can give his 1HP to Nero as he is not a physical creature... he is actually a summoned spirit
Is that the turn for Dumbledick?

Yes. Dumbledick's turn is finished 
Setto Kaiba — 02/21/2024 10:14 PM
He might focus on you, but he will attack whoever is in his way since he is boxed in and wouldn't make sense to try and fly around the room to get to you.
Then I believe it is Au'lun and then Enyawd
Toombz — 02/21/2024 10:17 PM
But I'm on the tile above Peridot right next to the wraith based on this map @Setto Kaiba. If I was wrong about the map, then Dumbledick would like to use his movement to get right in the face of thr wraith so that he is right next to it within 5ft

You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry.

Toombz — Yesterday at 12:42 AM
After Ae'lun's attack, Dumbledick throws more verbal tirades at the wraith's way in order to keep the attention of the wraith on himself:
"Did ghosty moisty get a boo boo and now needs his pacifier because he's about to cry? Ncaawwwww there there now.." (Get it, because he's a ghost and ghosts go boo and it's a double entendre and uh... nevermind)

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 7:31 AM
As you take your Warhammer to smash this ghost, the curse takes hold and it deals 12 points of damage to you before you are able to attack...Lying there, unconscious, and not moving, the Warhammer seemingly dissolves from your hand and blows aways like smoke in a soft breeze.

The ghost will focus his gaze on Dumbledick and stretching his hand out will attempt to pull the life force from him...

Tova will slowly open her eyes and take in the sounds around her. Not sure who to thank for her still being here, she will slowly sit up and look around at the scene before her. Seeing the wraith still in action, she will get up, but she won't make an opportunity attack because she's still a little too groggy to pull her weapon out in time.

Arden once more calls upon the ancient and sacred energies of Zivara that course through the veins of the world. With a deep, grounding breath that draws upon the very core of his being, he summons forth a radiant flame [Produce Flame (Cantrip)]. The fire dances within his open palm. Arden thrusts the flame forward, directing it towards the heart of the wraith with all the force his spirit can muster.

To Hit: 1d20 (20) + 5 = 25
Damage (CRIT!): 2d8 (4, 1) = 5
Effect
A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Ever the battle whore: Dumbledick, standing face to face with the Wraith, is sporting a big smile on his face because epic, life & death clashes are what he lives for. He is also extremely happy that he's got the wraith's full attention especially because his allies are low on health. He recognizes the urgency to build his greatest defense possible but he first casts Sacred Flame as a Cantrip. @Setto Kaiba I need a DC 12 (I think) dexterity saving throw 
Dumbledick then says to the wraith "I admire you for the  great honour you have and must admit that your last attack nearly hit me and is one of the mightiest blows I have ever faced. I would love to see you try it again." Dumbledick hopes that these words will encourage the Wraith to further attack him and only him, not his allies and equally as important, hopes these words will encourage the wraith to stay & fight instead of run away. He then casts Shield of Faith as his Bonus action and ends his turn.

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 1:28 PM
Arden once more calls upon the ancient and sacred energies of Zivara that course through the veins of the world. With a deep, grounding breath that draws upon the very core of his being, he summons forth a radiant flame [Produce Flame (Cantrip)]. The fire dances within his open palm. Arden thrusts the flame forward, directing it towards the heart of the wraith with all the force his spirit can muster.

Arden Greenwood casts Produce Flame!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (20) + 5 = 25
Damage (CRIT!): 2d8 (4, 1) = 5
Effect
A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for the duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you cast it again.

You can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Ever the battle whore: Dumbledick, standing face to face with the Wraith, is sporting a big smile on his face because epic, life & death clashes are what he lives for. He is also extremely happy that he's got the wraith's full attention especially because his allies are low on health. He recognizes the urgency to build his greatest defense possible but he first casts Sacred Flame as a Cantrip. @Setto Kaiba I need a DC 12 (I think) dexterity saving throw 
Dumbledick then says to the wraith "I admire you for the  great honour you have and must admit that your last attack nearly hit me and is one of the mightiest blows I have ever faced. I would love to see you try it again." Dumbledick hopes that these words will encourage the Wraith to further attack him and only him, not his allies and equally as important, hopes these words will encourage the wraith to stay & fight instead of run away. He then casts Shield of Faith as his Bonus action and ends his turn.

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:33 PM
With the wraith's presence no longer a threat, Arden, guided by the teachings of Zivara and his deep connection to the natural world, turns his attention to the weary group. He motions to his allies, a silent beckoning back to the warmth and safety of his makeshift campfire. "Comrades, our spirits have been tested this day, and through our combined strength, we have prevailed," he begins, his voice carrying the weight of their shared ordeal yet imbued with a comforting warmth. "Let us take this moment to rest, to heal not just the wounds of the flesh but those of the soul. I will prepare a meal in honor of Zivara, that we may draw strength from the earth as we share in this bounty."

While the others settle, Arden will work and craft a new staff, weaving together branches, roots, and twigs collected from the grand tree, a physical manifestation of their resilience and unity. Each motion is a meditation, each selection a prayer, embodying the cycle of growth and renewal that defines their journey. In this act, Arden finds solace and strength, a silent vow to continue. 
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:49 PM
Once the sheer adrenaline and chaos of the fight comes to pass Nero slips into his shell so fast that he is left spinning on the alter. A long rest is definitely in order 😂🙈💀
Toombz — Today at 12:38 AM
So I guess Nero, Peridot and Dumbledick are team sleep while the others are doing their own thing. 

Just a side note that a minute before the long rest officially takes place whenever that is, Dumbledick would like to use his last 2nd level spell slot to cast Aid on himself, Peridot and fellow cleric Tova. Aid is supposed to last 8 hours, but laced with 1 sorcery point, doubles the time to 16 hours. So Dumbledick, Peridot and Tova each gain 5 HP and have their HP maximum increased by 5 HP for the next 16 hours after the long rest begins officially. Dumbledick will repeat this exact spell every 16 hours 
Jarrod — Today at 12:43 AM
Peridot will just need 4 hours and will take watch from there
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:18 AM
Arden too will only require 4 hours to gain full refreshment

Burger — Today at 7:50 AM
Can I long rest?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:55 AM
Tova... Looking into the hallway you do not see much, it is dark and with your darvisiok you only see. What you so see and remember from prevuliously is a 10ft space that you can walk as normal, followed by atleast a 5ft "fake" piece of ground and covered by illusion magic to appear as normal ground and then beyound that Enyawd has scattered some loose rocks that revealed another 10ft of small jagged outcroppings of rock just large enough to stand with your feet close together. Beyond that is another room...
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:00 AM
This is indeed what the party is discussing now... who wants to take atleast 8 hours (or 4 for some) to rest up ( long rest)... How that will work, who is keeping watch, are you doing it in shifts, are you barricading the entrance to the new room after Tova has looked at it considering that a ghost just flies through it anyway, is there more ghosts or other creatures further in this cave that might attack you. Are you removing your armor (as in this game, when you wear heavy armor and sleep in it you will receive disadvantage on your attacks the next day)... all these questions you have to deal with...
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 8:38 AM
I believe shifts always work best. We can use the desks to barricade the othe passage if need be although if it's another ghost we are dead anyway lol. So let's take our chances and the first 2 of the 4hour sleepers and the 8 hour people go first leaving 1 or 2 as look out. Then when the first 4 hours pass the watchers swap with the first group of 4 hour people thud when the full 8 passes everyone is rested and there's always someone awake
I'd recommend those with 4 hours needed and heavy amour go on watch first as you can keep watch while removing surely
Ky — Today at 8:56 AM
I don't know how the elves (Peridot and Arden) would feel but in my mind it makes sense if those that need 8 hours take 8 hours and the elves switch off, that way we don't extend the period of vulnerability and everyone  gets a rest. The disadvantage to this is that there is only one person doing perception checks. Either way works, just thought I'd throw it out there
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:21 AM
Enyawd gingerly stands up... his balance is not great but he feels lighter somehow. He takes off his armor. Goblinsbane is gone, and he is not too sure what to make of that. He bows low to his party members, before collapsing into a long, 8 hour sleep 
Jarrod — Today at 9:23 AM
So what you saying is peridot and arden do shifts in keeping watch?
Toombz — Today at 9:26 AM
Yeah I feel like this is a great idea. @Deformiter (Arden) is still pretty fresh on health and you and him only need 4 hours of rest while we all need 8 hours. That way, after 8 hours are done, everyone will have gotten rest 
Toombz — Today at 9:28 AM
Yeah Dumbledick will do the same. Armour off before 8 hour slumber
Jarrod — Today at 9:41 AM
Could peridot take the first nap
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:23 AM
As you all make ready to take a long rest, some of you already having removed your armor and just enjoying your meal made by Arden, you suddenly hear a "thud" and then the sound of stone grinding against stone as a door opens behind the sarcophagus in the top right hand corner...
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 10:27 AM
So long as Arden doesn't need to defend or attack, he should be fit enough to take first watch and continue working on his staff while keeping an eye out for any potential intruders.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:35 AM
Enyawd is not fussed. We'll check it out tomorrow. First sleep
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:44 AM
Enyawd to tired to even respond, turns and continue to sleep...

As the door opens, you see a 7ft tall Orc step through the door, Warpick in hand. He steps in slowly unsure of what he will find inside and then spots the party...

Burdok stepping out into the room the door behind you slides back into place. You see a room with 6 sarcophagai and on the eastern wall is a massive tree whos roots you see in this room with a large chest set at it's foot. The chest looks unopened or perhaps just closed again.
To your right and left you see 2 hallways that has been blocked off (the west)  by the giant stone lids from the sarcophagai and the east by 2 wooden desks.
The party you see all seem spent, barely holding on to their lives... Should you attack you feel you would probably be able to take them... Especially the dwarf sleeping not even lifting his head 🤣

Perhaps all of you can share what Burdok sees when he looks at the party...
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:43 PM
Nero hearing the commotion from within his turtle shell... proceeds to whisper to his nearest companion."pssst ... Oi...what's going on out there?....if it's friendly treat it gently... if it's foe we hit and go.... and then the echo In the shell fades as he drifts off back to sleep on the alter" 
Ky — Today at 12:50 PM
Looking at Tova, you will see a short (even by Dwarf standards) and burly female dwarf with flaming red hair. Currently she is busy taking her armor off after 1 fight to many. She's bleeding and her clothes are torn, she's dirty and sweating and grumpy as all hell because everytime things calm down, new creatures appear and she has nothing left in her to fight with at this moment. Her hands are shaking and fumbling with the armor and she is dead tired. Once her armor is off, she will fall to the floor in a heap and sleep where she lands
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:53 PM
Arden, holding a plate of food prepared by his own hands, extends it towards the Orc as a gesture of peace and fellowship. "We are well aware of the dangers that lurk in the shadows of this place," Arden speaks, his voice as steady and comforting as the earth beneath them, "and though we find ourselves weary and wounded, our spirits remain unbroken. I ask if you might join me in keeping watch over my companions this night. Your presence could lend us much-needed strength and ensure the safety of those who now rest."
-
[Arden is a male Wood Elf with an autumnal palette; his long, wavy hair blends the rich browns, deep reds, and oranges of fallen leaves. His vibrant green eyes mirror the fresh foliage of the forest, and his skin has the warm, earthy hue of tree bark. He wears a cloak that mimics the forest’s own cloak of leaves, suggesting a seamless unity with nature. His overall demeanor is one of tranquility and deep spiritual connection to the natural world around him.] 
Toombz — Today at 12:58 PM
He will see Dumbledick with his shield in one hand together with a plate of food, and an eating utensil in another. With the use of his mage hand, he was able to remove his armour fairly quickly. He takes one last bite of his food, looks to the new entrant into the dungeon, and after brief thought, puts his head down and goes to sleep with his shield in hand as is his tradition
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:07 PM
Sensing he is no immediate threat Nero would like to extend a paw out of his shell and in a eco says to the new guy....pointing at the chest in the room...." see that.....no .....touchy....got it" and then goes back to bed
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 1:10 PM
Ae'lun, a ranger air genasi with long pale blue hair and one good blue eye lies on the floor petting Shnuggles, a small green frog with wings and multiple sets of eyes, its lying peacfully on Ae'lun's chest purring like a cat
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:11 PM
The orc speaks as he takes the plate of food from the ginger elf , "The name's Burdok" He sniffs the food and takes a bite hoping that it is not poisoned, after not having a solid meal for a few days already, he gobbles up what remains on his plate, and responds to the elf "I'll keep watch with you, but try anything and you and your friends will be on your way to the hells."
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:27 PM
"Hey Elf, what is your name @Deformiter (Arden), and what are you lot doing in a crypt?"
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:42 PM
"I am Arden," he begins, his voice carrying the serene confidence of the forest at dawn. We are here to aid a nearby town, who have been plagued by goblins. The King has dismissed their plight and the citizens were in need, we found the threat not only to be real but far more dangerous than we had anticipated. Our path has been fraught with danger. We have almost lost many of our allies and sadly have already lost one." He pauses, a moment of silence enveloping him like a cloak. "Among us was Patty, a young dwarf whose spirit, brave and bright, was extinguished too soon. He journeys now with Zivara, his essence woven interconnected with the weave of the world."
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:47 PM
"A pity bout patty"
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:48 PM
"Tell me about yourself Burdok?" Arden asks. "Are you familiar with the region?"
=MrFarmy= — Today at 1:50 PM
"No, I'm not from here, the world is my home wherever it leads me, wherever there is blood to spill I spill it, my god demands blood and I am all too happy to be his instrument" Burdok grins
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 2:02 PM
Arden's expression shifts subtly, a ripple of unease crossing his normally serene expression as Burdok speaks of bloodshed and devotion to a god of violence. This declaration, starkly contrasting with Arden's deeply held beliefs in the sanctity of life and the interconnectedness of all beings, prompts him to try steer the conversation away from the current discorse. "The world is vast and filled with many paths," Arden remarks, seeking common ground even in the face of such divergence. "Ours is a journey not just through the lands but through the very essence of existence, learning and growing with every step. Tell me, Burdok, have you encountered any sights on your travels that have stayed with you?"
While engaged in conversation with Burdok, Arden continues to work on crafting his new staff.
=MrFarmy= — Today at 2:07 PM
"I prefer not to talk about my past, the future is what matters, destiny awaits and fate it seems has brought me here, and what a glorious destiny awaits."
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 2:19 PM
"In the Zivara Lumynar, it is said, 'Let not the shadows of yesterday darken the steps of tomorrow. For every journey beneath the sun and moon is a testament to the strength of the spirit seeking its destiny.' Your words resonate with the wisdom of the Lumynar, friend. We are all seekers in this existence, our paths intertwined by fate yet led by the choices we make. May our journey forward be guided by the understanding and the compass of our shared destinies."
Toombz — Today at 2:20 PM
@Setto Kaiba I just wanted to ask because I saw this on a video, is it true that you can cast leveled spells without expending a spell slot so long as it is cast as a ritual and has the ritual tag? (If you cast it for 10 minutes rather than the 1 action or 1 minute requirement written"?
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:23 PM
Burdock will see a dodgy looking mountain dwarf curled up, recuperating from a rough few minutes 😂. The dwarf has black hair and two braids in his beard. His armor is neatly packed besides him. You hear him whimper something about goblinsbane
Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:16 PM
If it has the ritual tag then yes, that is true. You add 10min to the casting time (so a 1min spell will take 11min and a 1 action spell will take the action and 10min).
Toombz — Today at 4:17 PM
Thanks bro. I wanna use Spell slots as sparingly and efficiently as possible so this is good new information to keep in mind

While the party takes a much needed rest, Arden, Burdok and Snuggles keeps a close eye out for any danger. Listening carefully to hear the occasional sounds of the party members snoring, but other than that nothing of note happens... Is there anything your characters would like to do on their watch?
=MrFarmy= — Today at 8:15 PM
Burdok takes his small knife from his backpack, and starts carcing at the hilt of his warpick, for some time now he has been carving a skull into the hilt, whilst doing this he recites a seemingly neverending list of names, all women.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 8:41 PM
Arden will join Burdok in some crafting work, working on his new staff, although he will occasionally keep shifting his eyes toward Burdok, wondering about his safety still.

Ae'lun needs a full rest, Shnuggles doesn't need to sleep though
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:49 PM
Arden, with a sense of fulfillment and pride, gazes upon the newly crafted and atuned Staff of the Woodlands, feeling its power pulsate gently under his fingertips, flowing with the essence of Zivara. Turning to Burdok, he places a hand on the Orc's shoulder, a gesture of camaraderie and gratitude. "Your vigilance through the night has not gone unnoticed, Burdok," Arden speaks, his voice carrying the serene timbre of the forest's whisper. With these words of thanks and well-wishing, Arden steps towards the massive, ancient tree. Here, he settles into a deep trance, embracing the elven practice of meditation that transcends mere rest. In this sacred communion with the natural world, Arden seeks not only rejuvenation but a deeper connection to the life force that binds all beings.

Enyawd rolls over in his sleep... Dreaming of burgers and pizza and burger patties made of pizza on top of pizza
And ale. Copious amounts of ale... Pizza burger Pizzas islands in a sea of ale
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:29 AM
As you all settle in for a good long rest, Peridot taking the second shift watching over the party... Your rest passes without incident.

Everybody can get the full benefit of a long rest...

After resting and healing up, bandaging wounds and having a good meal and meeting a new potential ally...what would you like to do?
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:31 AM
Enyawd wakes up, puts on his armor and groggily looks at the orc... "You been here the whole time?"
Toombz — Today at 10:49 AM
Dumbledick also awakens, dons his armour quickly with the assistance of Mage Hand, & enhances his armour with the Blessing of the Forge. With his shield in hand and seeing that the new visitor has not killed Arden overnight, has no suspicion of the new potential ally as a threat. In fact, he relates to him as a new guy in the group and introduces himself to him. "Names Dumbledick, and what's yours"? @=MrFarmy=
Dumbledick also says good morning to everyone else and that he's happy to see everyone back to good health and asks if they are keen to further explore this cave and perhaps take it over and make it our new lair/stronghold? 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:51 AM
Amazing what a few hours of rest can do hey
Enyawd asks the orc if he has any breakfast ale... "To clarify, it's like lunch and dinner ale, but a tad stronger "
=MrFarmy= — Today at 10:58 AM
Burdok glares at Dumbledick for a second or two then grunts "Names Burdok" he then turns to Enyawd, "I do not have any ale sorry, I do not take alcohol, it dulls the mind, and in these times you need a clear head"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:04 AM
Enyawd suddenly finds himself offended by the 7ft oaf... "Well then you shouldn't have to worry, there's nothing to dull"
=MrFarmy= — Today at 11:17 AM
Burdok just looks at Enyawd and does not give a response, he carries on carving on the hilt of his weapon and starts singing a tune "They gonna hang me, in the morning, before the night is done... They gonna hang me, in the morning, and I'll never see the sun..."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:22 AM
Stretching out of his shell Nero fruffles is auburn messy morning shell head and stares at the newcomer for a few minutes before turning to the group...."so I wasn't imagining it this time...huh with all the wierd dreams from last night I wasn't even sure I'd wake again..." he then looks over at the orc and introduces himself. "Hidyho big boi  the names Nero Eberloch and i be the senior resident scorcer ...glad to see you have something between those ears and headed my warning after all.....good" he crosses his legs on the alter and takes out a ration to munch on while he processes the previous battle. 
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 11:25 AM
Burdok responds to Nero "What I need is would not be in that chest, so why waste time looking inside"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:30 AM
"Either way I wouldn't  have cared I suppose...just being polite". Stay on our goodside and you're welcome to join our escapade of eradicating this goblin plight in the land( he leans forward and deadeyes Burdok)....but mark my words laddy.....one incaling of betrayal or anything of that nature and we'll use that very weapon you're playing wit as a dental aid and then burry you with it one in the same. Are we clear here?"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:32 AM
Considering there's no breakfast ale, Enyawd suggests asking the Orc dude if there is a way around the hole through the secret door he used
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 11:34 AM
Burdok gives a short laugh, "Many have tried, and many have died trying, but I mean you no harm unless you give me reason to."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:38 AM
Nero grins at his response and while scoping the room at the rest he mutters" yeah we've heard that line before...you may have fought in many battles ....but we cleanse realms im not buying the tough guy act"
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:39 AM
Arden greets the new day with a serene composure. Standing amidst his companions, his presence a calming balm, he offers a greeting as warm as the morning sun. "Good morning to all," he begins, his voice carrying the tranquility of a still forest. "As Zivara teaches us, 'With each sunrise, we are given a chance for renewal, an invitation to weave new tales into life.' Let us embrace this day not just as survivors of the night's shadows, but as architects of our fate, united in purpose and spirit."
Ky — Today at 11:43 AM
Tova will wake up, stretch her body slowly, feeling bit by bit if everything is still working 🤣 then she will do her morning prayer ritual and put her armor back on while she sliently watches the new guy and the party members size each other up. She thanks Peridot and Arden for keeping a watch during the night. She thanks Mr snuggles too. She will pull out some rations and chew on the dried and lathered something
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:45 AM
Does the United purpose of druid craft produce the spirit of morning caffeine beans?😅😅😅
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:55 AM
Arden contemplates the request for the essence of morning's wakefulness. With a thought, he summons the magic of Druidcraft, coaxing the earth to yield the cherried bounty of Coffea arabica, each bean a vessel of invigorating promise. With care, he gathers the harvest, and with a flicker of Produce Flame, kindles a fire that crackles with life's fervor. The beans, cast into a makeshift roaster, begin their transformation, their aroma a testament to the druid's mastery over the elements. This act, a simple yet profound offering, is Arden's way of nurturing the bond among the weary souls gathered around the fire. As the coffee brews, its rich scent weaving through the air, Arden reflects on the unity fostered by shared moments of solace, a silent ode to the interconnectedness of all life, as taught by Zivara.
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 11:56 AM
Burdok who has never had coffee before "What is that, it smells good" 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:58 AM
"Coffee," Arden explains with a smile as gentle as the morning sun, "is a brew that awakens the spirit and sharpens the mind, much like the first light of dawn dispels the shadows of night."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:58 AM
Nero drifts over to Arden and responds to the orc....the essence of energy and life itself. Gives you the power of 10 warriors. Good stuff he exclaims while patiently waiting for the brew to ready."
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:59 AM
[ Ok, now I actually need to go make coffee, brb 😄 ]
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 12:01 PM
Burdok is intrigued "Does it contain alcohol?" 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:12 PM
That would be an "Irish fey cream" Nero remarks....used to be mothers favorite....but being a arcane dragon Priestess in the afterlife I suppose she has no further use of it.
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 12:14 PM
"Any chance I could try some? Without alcohol of course, It tingles senses that I have not known I had"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 12:22 PM
Enyawd, tired of the teetotalers, heads off towards to secret passageway to explore... considering the stench coming from it - he can only assume the orc was down here for some time. He carefully watches his step to not get his boots soiled as he explores the passage beyond
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:27 PM
Arden turns towards the towering figure of Burdok, "Of course, you are welcome to share with us, we have little to offer, but thank you for your watchful eye last evening,". Then, casting a vigilant glance towards Enyawd's retreating form, Arden raises his voice, ensuring it carries through the dimly lit space, "Enyawd, venture not too far alone into the shadows. The unknown here is vast and filled with perils we have yet to uncover."
Ky — Today at 12:38 PM
Quick question, who is the most dexterous among us and who is the strongest/biggest? Tova's strength is not bad but she's small.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:49 PM
Strength - Pizza with 19+4
Dex - Peridot with 20+5
Biggest (height) probably Burdok with 7ft ( not sure on others heights as sheets dont have details 😄 )
Toombz — Today at 1:03 PM
@Ky @Jarrod don't forget to add +5 to your HP because for the next 8 hours you have my Aid spell boosting your HP maximum. In 8 hours, I'm gonna cast Aid again. Once I level up, this benefit will become +10 when I use a 3rd level slot
Jarrod — Today at 1:04 PM
gotcha thanks
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:17 PM
is that for everyone? or just them?
Toombz — Today at 1:20 PM
It's just for them and myself unfortunately. I can only target 3 creatures with it. I can cast it twice again so it covers everyone but it will burn too many spell slots so I wanna only cast it once a day and if i have any slots leftover at night, cast it again. I choose @Jarrod because he's a damage beast and @Ky because she's the resident healer if anyone is dying so they need to be as durable as possible. 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:22 PM
No worries 🙂

Ky — Today at 2:12 PM

A standard desk is 1.2m, 5ft is 1.52m. It won't fit 🤔 I thought Peridot could see what is that side. We might not need to all go across

i mean i can just leap over the hole as far as we know its only 5 feat
Toombz — Today at 3:33 PM
If this is correct, then to leap over the 5ft hole, you need your strength modifier to be +2 or more. Is it? 

And anyone else have a strength modifier of +2 or more so they could also jump over? @Setto Kaiba is this source legit?
Image
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:37 PM
I think this would be a long jump
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:39 PM
Looking into the hallway it is just over 30ft long and 5ft wide. The first 10ft you know to be solid ground. Then there is a 5ft gap that appears like normal ground but it falls away into a cavern below as far as you can see. Then beyond that is another 15ft that appears to be normal ground, but the little stones that Enyawd threw to there revealed small outcroppings of rock in the middle that you need to cross  to get to the room (so that last more or less 15ft is not solid ground it is little outcroppings like stalagmites). Beyond that is a room. You currently have no idea what is in that room. 

These are all things you discovered before...when you had light there.
Toombz — Today at 3:41 PM
Then I suppose everyone can jump over, even me who has a strength score of 8🤣🤣

Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:47 PM

Toombz — Today at 3:51 PM
So who wants to be the first to try and jump? Then they can use a sword/staff or whatever to test and see if there is solid ground before they continue walking forward
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:55 PM
Enyawd will pick up some stones and go hopping... Much like a game his niece used to play... Is snuggles a flying glow frog? 
Ky — Today at 4:08 PM
You just need to hope we all roll well 🤣
Tova will cast light on Shnuggles
Jarrod — Today at 4:14 PM
peridot being dexi will jump across and then be very careful to see if any other holes are in place
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 4:16 PM
Peridot should take the handful of stones, and tie the rope around him well ... the 7ft oaf can be tied to the other end of the rope - just in case
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:18 PM
Shnuggles will freak out slightly as he starts glowing, Ae'lun will scratch the top of his head "don't worry buddy you're not going to explode. Do me a favor and keep an eye or six over our friend Peri over there" Shnuggles will float above lighting his way
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 4:38 PM
So for clarity, those last 15ft arnt solid ground, but the tips of stalagmites? Were they tested with the rocks to ensure they're solid?

Arden would throw a small pebble on the ground that we know is an illusion to see if they fall through - this will provide enough information to know that the perceived futher solid ground is not also an illusion that has a weight limit before the illusion fails.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:06 PM
Yes...  so for 5ft there is nothing. Then for another 15ft that you know of there is a stalagmite or two to jump on. The tricky part is that it all looks like real floor. One or two of the small stones are staying on the floor while the rest fell through the floor and into the abyss. Just by looking at the floor you don't know what is real and what is not and where exactly the stalagmites are 🤔... Beyond into the room you have no idea what awaits...
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 5:09 PM
lol, wait, so on the same piece of floor, some rocks are staying while others fall through? and that's on the floor that we know is an illusion?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:11 PM
Snuggles can't talk... but he has an intel of 8... so he is about like this 👇
Image
Yes... all the rocks fall through on the first 5ft so there is nothing to stand on... one or two little rocks remain in place while the rest fell through on the remaining 15ft...
It is not just jumping... it is first figuring out where to jump before you can jump 😅
Toombz — Today at 5:23 PM
@Setto Kaiba then I will constantly cast Mage Hand in order to accurately map out where the solid ground is. Can I do that? Mage Hand works up to 30 ft 
Image
I will use the hand to press against the ground and if it goes through the ground, we can be certain there is no solid surface but if it can press, we know where to land
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 5:41 PM
So if I used speak with animals he could actually be an okay scout?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:43 PM
Yeah I'd say so...It won't be able to say like what is ahead, but simple things like id their humans, are their living things etc.
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 5:43 PM
Cool thank you
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:45 PM
That would potentially work... however you would have to plan exactly as when it is by solid ground it might have to stay there to ensure you know where to jump to as when it moves you cannot tell again.
Toombz — Today at 5:48 PM
Good enough for me🙌 @Jarrod we have the rope, @Burger is willing to tie it around you and himself so he can pull you up in case you fall and I can use my mage hand to show you where to land. Are you ready to jump?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:50 PM
If you have snuggles lighting the way, the mage hand guiding you and the rope I will give you advantage on the Acrobatics Check to see if you can make the jump. We will set the DC:16 as it is fairly challenging.

You manage to hold onto the outcrop. A weird sensation as you see the floor yet you also see the deep abyss below... You manage to pull yourself up, balancing carefully on this narrow piece of stalagmite... Please give me another dex check at advantage...

@Setto Kaiba my mage hand only has a range of 30ft😅 just a heads up
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:31 PM
You jump from the outcrop and narrowly misses the opposite ledge as you touch the ledge but is just not able to hold onto it as you drop down...dangling at the end of the rope.
Who is holding on to the rope?
Toombz — Today at 6:34 PM
@Burger has the rope tied to his waist
And i guess we could all be holding onto him too for s strong base

Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:42 PM
Peridot, as you dangle at the end of the rope... the rope slipping slightly as your companions above try to pull you back, you see something perhaps 40ft below (so 10ft below you) it might just be the light from Snuggles plying tricks, but it seems like a cave opening...

CON Save: 1d20 (9) + 5 = 14; Success!
Effect
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

Dumbledick weighs 200 lbs. Let's say you already dropped him off on the last tile we saw @Jarrod on. So you have more space to go get more people. Maybe we can say you dropped off the Dwarfs too?

Arden, ever resourceful and attuned to the natural magics that course through him, chooses a path less conventional, he silently invokes the spell of Spider Climb upon himself.
Toombz — Yesterday at 8:25 PM
I'm pretty sure you can carry one person hey?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 8:28 PM
Arden has 10 strength
and Spider Climb doesnt turn him into a spider, it just lets him walk on walls and ceilings 🙂
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 8:31 PM
Well carry capacity is 30x your strenght ...
you move at half movement though
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 8:36 PM
Push, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.
a lot more than half 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 8:37 PM
There is not enough space for people to float and Peridot to make the jump... so since Peridot took first action to move accross he will get there first... Standing at the "edge" looking into the new room you see behind you Dumbledick floating on Nero's back coming accross the false floor. As Dumbledick gets off Nero, the two of you stand there peering into the room, with Snuggles behind in the hallway providing light for the other party members.

Peridot, please give me a perception check at disadvantage or if you ask Au'lun to insteuct Snuggles to float into the room it will be a straight check.

Dumbledick, please give me a Strength Check to get Nero back to the start.
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 8:38 PM
Also will likely require a str check mid-carry and I have +0 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 8:38 PM

Dumbledick... you push Nero back to the other side... he speeds off and then slowly reaches the starting point... Who is going next on the shell ride?

Peridot, looking into this room you see a 30ft wide by 50ft long room. On the walls you see more carvings and depictions of the battleas you saw in the previous room. On th far side (Eastern Side - you are entering from the South West) you see a large stone statue, it looks like a replica of the ghost you encountered earlier. Infront of this you also see a sarcophagus, the lid partly open. Both the Sarcophagus and the statue is slightly elevated from the rest of the room about 4 steps to get to them.

The rest of the room you see 8 chests standing 4 to the North and 4 to the South, arranged in a neat line.

Dumbledick, after you push Nero you can step in as well seeing the same.

Arden, you cast your spell and then gently start walking up the side of the wall as if it was flat ground. You walk up and then walk upside-down 30ft above the hallway until you also reach the room at the end. Looking in, you too see this.
Toombz — Yesterday at 9:17 PM

In my mind it's 50ft to the wall ahead of us. So if we use the left rectangle, we either enter the room from the top or bottom

If we use the right rectangle, we either enter the room from the left or right. But @Setto Kaiba will confirm. While we wait, maybe you can plot out both maps just in case unless it's too much work, then let's wait for DM

And don't just open. It may be trapped...or if dm is trying the funny approach they may all be dam mimics. Let's be smart here...just incase
Being cautious of the previous chest @Setto Kaiba can Nero investigate the room to see if the chests are trapped from our viewpoint 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:15 PM
I go away for 5min 😂 Ok... Let me see...

Yes, the map seems correct in specifications.

Nero, your levitate will be a little short on time... as you float in you can fee the effects starting to wear off as yoy gently float to the ground.

Arden, you can easily continue your walk on the wall and up onto the ceiling...hanging upside-down in the center of the room.

Au'lun... with your Investigation Check... as you walk around the room, just looking at everything and not touching anything, you see an inscription carved on the tomb "He who is willing to sacrifice will gain great rewards".

Tova, the pictures in this room is very similar to the pictures in the other room. They depict a battle between the knights and the goblins... in this image you see a knight killing the goblins and some goblins running away.

Depending on what information you are looking for, the rest of you can either make an Investigation Check or a Perception Check or an Arcana Check...
Toombz — Today at 1:30 PM
Hearing the terrified voice of Nero, Dumbledick will refrain from opening the chests because he agrees that they may be trapped and will invite Nero to investigate if the northern chests are trapped while he checks the southern chests. @Setto Kaiba can we only do 1 investigation check per chest? Or 1 check covers all the chests?

Tova will answer Ae'lun 'perhaps 🤔'.

Then she will move over to the chest to see if she can pick up anything, maybe something she recalls from the books
Toombz — Today at 2:06 PM
To Dumbledick this still seems like Nero is terrified because he himself was WORRIED about the chests having a touch trap activation like the previous one hence the desire to not use his own hand. So hearing Nero say he shouldn't even touch with the mage hand leads him to conclude he is "more than worried" hence he believes the word terrified is appropriate 🤣 but hey, Dumbledick ultimately agrees that it's better to be safe or extra extra safe than sorry or extra extra sorry
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:09 PM
I believe so seeing as the ritual didn't do anything physical when performed perhaps it merely opened the way to this room. We gave a sacrifice and this is our reward?
Toombz — Today at 2:11 PM
Different character personalities makes the game more fun anyways hence why the introduction of @Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy is so invigorating 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:15 PM
Call it what you like but Nero has no fear of death he has danced with it many a time...however ones silly actions could have follow on consequences or destroy critical info that we would get if we are careful...heck opening a chest set of a bunch of traps that could potentially put the entire party at risk and we don't want to have a repeat of the last room thinking we had won only for an unexpected second threat following as a result of the first.... get it? I'd rather be "terrified" and live to get out of here but Nero speaks for himself in this regard.
Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 2:17 PM
Burdok upon hearing what Ae'lun has said after reading the inscription decides that all this cloak and dagger sneaky sneaky nonsense is taking too long, he grabs his small knife from his backpack, approaches the statue hoping he doesn't trigger any traps and starts checking out the statue.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:21 PM
@Setto Kaiba  can Nero first investigate the closest chest on the southern side  before trying to use mage hand to open it
Toombz — Today at 2:23 PM
I'm not sure if this is a perception or investigation check, but maybe investigation check?
Toombz — Today at 2:27 PM
Dumbledick nods approvingly and doesn't believe Burdock is terrified but seeing him also walking in a cautious manner leads him to believe he may be worried about traps like himself but also has a hint of impatience 🤣🤣
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:31 PM
One Investigation Check for all... just to speed things along... However you can try and use another type of check on another chest should you wish. Like an Investigation on one and an Arcan on the other etc.

Dumbledick and Nero... Looking at the chests you notice that they seem slightly off... Nero, you notice that there is a sense of illusion magic at work on all these chests.

Peridot, similar to the others... you notice the carvings and and depictions on the walls, the statue and the sarcophagus with the inscriptions and the chests that seem slightly weird.

Burdok, you walk up to the statue looking at it... It does not seem to have any markings on it except gor normal wear from time. It does not seem to be magical or have any defined characteristics beside being just a statue.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:39 PM
Hmm I bet atleast 1 is a mimic.... I tell the others....looks like my "terrifiedness" was warranted after all....it appears these chests are enveloped in illusion magic just like the previous one....so I say again....please be careful...."
@Setto Kaiba you say the chests have wierd inscriptions on them....can any of us determine what they say?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 2:58 PM
"Hmm illusion magic and sacrifice, could the chests thirst for blood too?"
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 3:01 PM
Think you may be onto something there.... those with mage hand can carry over some blood and test it out just incase there's second step other than the blood to opening it.
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 3:03 PM

Peridot, you are able to read the inscriptions, each chest seems to have the same, a spell of some sort... Yet they do not make much sense out of context... 

Arden, hearing Peridot read the inscriptions you recognize some elements of this... The chests have some sort of illusion magic cast upon it, yet you also detect a hint of another kind of magic...The chests seem to all be linked. You would know that the magic itself is harmless, it creates more of a puzzle to solve than a harmful effect.

I suppose that one could work I was going to try the one closest to me. But perhaps the one at the center may be a better guess...maby dumble can follow suit and we can try both as he says
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 3:37 PM
You have to mr😑.... it says sacrifice not death😂🙈
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:37 PM
True.. There is an important distinction🤣🤣 
Hearing Nero talk about sacrifice, Dumbledick looks at Ae'lun, then at Shnuggles and has a look of deep thought on his face but keeps his thoughts to himself 
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:46 PM
@Setto Kaiba we go for both. Nero for the chests and Dumbledick for the Sarcophagus
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 3:58 PM
Dumbledick you cut your hand causing some blood to fall on the sarcophagus... then after waiting a few seconds nothing happens.

Nero, you do the same... with your blood falling on the chest. As it does so, you see a blood stain appear on all the chests and for a second the illusion seems to fade and thr chests seems to shift more towards reality than illusion.
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:01 PM
@Turtlebaff420 I guess either we need you to pour more of your blood till you pass out or more of our brethren here (and sistren if that's a word) may have to volunteer before you end up a full sacrifice. Either way let's see what these illusionary chests are hiding
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 4:06 PM
Arden would suggest that perhaps we need someone sacrificing blood at each of the chests.
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 4:14 PM
"It's worth a try" Ae'lun walks towards a chest while drawing his dagger
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:16 PM
Agreed. So the 4 of us will each take a chest and 2 more volunteers maybe? If not, 2 of us may need to take 2 chests each🤣🤣

Toombz — Yesterday at 4:33 PM

Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 4:34 PM
Burdok is ALL about blood...
Burdok, seeing what the others are doing, murmers a few ritualistic words in his own language, and makes a cut in his left hand, with his right index and middle fingers he pushes into the cut, which covers his fingers with blood, and then proceeds to draw a line from the center of his forehead downward between his eyes and over his nose. He then sucks the blood off his fingers and lets out a devilish laugh. "Muaaaaghaghaghaghagha" blood and saliva drooling from his mouth. 
Ky — Yesterday at 4:50 PM

Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 4:58 PM
Burdok seeing that there is still not enough blood being spilt takes out his knife again, and chops off his left ear! Blood spraying all over the place, he just laughs in utter ecstasy.

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 5:39 PM
Standing next to your chest, each of you offer up a little blood... a sacrifice to obtain the reward... you see your blood drip onto the chest. Each drop of blood appearing on your chest as well as all the others...For a second it appears as if nothing has changed, untill suddenly you see the chests starting to glow... a faint aura at first but growing in intensity. As you all kinda step back and cover your eyes you see Burdok glowing in a similar fashion and then explode in a radiance of pure white light... 

As you open your eyes, and realize that Burdok is no more... you each see an item infront of you...

and that is where we shall leave it tonight as I have some work to attend to so we shall find out what you each find tomorrow...

Arden steps forth to the spot once occupied by Burdok. His movements are deliberate. With a voice imbued with the serene strength of the forest, he recites from the Lumynar, "In the cycle of life, each end is but a new beginning. May the energies that once danced within you, Burdok, find their path back to Zivara, weaving into it strength, wisdom, and the promise of renewal." The words seem to momentarily stir the air, as if the very essence of life itself acknowledges the truth within them.

Listening to Arden's words, yet also not particularly saddened as you never really got to know Burdok, you all stand there looking down to the chest at your side...

Au'lun... you find 2 x Daggers, the blades forged by master craftsmen.    (They are +1 daggers)

Arden... you find 2 x vials with a shimmering red liquid in them. (They are Potions of Greater healing)

Dumbledick... you find a sword, made of a fine metal, with a split at the end of the balde creating a "2 prong fork". The hilt has 4 gemstones set into it and is wrapped with fine red leather strap.  (It is a Sword of Life Stealing - shortsword)

Enyawd... You find a pair of boots, crafted from the finest leather, adorned with elven symbols (These are Boots of Elven Kind)

Nero... You find a shield, shaped similar to your shell but made from dragon scales (This is a +1 shield)

Tova... You find a golden ring with a red stone set into the top and lined with smaller white stones (This is a Ring of Spell Storing)

Peridot... You find a finely crafter wooden quarterstaff. Wrapped with leather straps to increase grip. At the tips, 3 iron rings on either side increases the damage dealt to foes (This is a +1 Quarterstaff)

Pizza... You find a mace, the head with the shape of a skull at the end and the hilt wrapped in a blue leather strap (This is a mace of terror)
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:58 PM
Peridot... Having not been near the chest, you find this upon the sarcophagus that you were standing close to.
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:00 PM

Nero notices the door sliding and immediately raises his new shield
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:10 PM
Dumbledick, as a Forge Domain Cleric, is very pleased with the craftsmanship of his sword and so will sheath it. Upon hearing the door open he looks to it and assumes the dodge action ready for a potential battle
He suspects it may be Burdok teleported into the room next to their current location

Standing ready, Nero and Dumbledick... you feel a fresh mountain breeze coming from beyond and the smell of freshly cooked meat immediately draws your attention.

Pizza, walks up to Nero and Dumbledick and with a firm conviction says, "I sense evil beyond this doorway" as he lights a torch and draws his longsword. He cautiously walks up to the doorway, inspecting the arch for any symbols or traps and then slowly edges forward.

As you watch him slowly making his way to the end of the hallway, he says loudly and with a sense of hope and relief... "there is light, a way out, into the forest it would seem".

Just as he turns, you see a massive giant spider decend upon him, sinking it's fangs dripping with poison into his flesh and then quickly retreating with his limp body  in tow...

Burdok Bloodclaw / MrFarmy — Today at 1:55 PM
Whats your take on Plum & Lamb 👀
Toombz — Today at 1:56 PM
One important lesson I learned is to never piss off (no pun intended) the people who make your food.. That's why I always get angry when I'm with someone eating out and they throw a fit or something at the people making or serving the food. I make it a point to go to the kitchen and say "please shit in their food, not mine. I don't even like that person either"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:57 PM
I had a smoked plum jus with gazpacho and that was actually lovely....

Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 3:35 PM
Since the rest are arguing about this flat food thing and fruit, Enyawd will cut Pizza free from the webbing, while cautiously looking for other "victims" that may be alive - and also for more spiders
"Stop arguing about fruit on bread and meat, and help me drag Pizza to safety. Tova, will you give him a quick check - the paralytic poison should wear off soon. Well, that's what happened to Thorkram"
Ky — Today at 3:38 PM
Tova will help Enwayd move Pizza and do a medicine check to see if he needs more healing.

Arden does a medicine check as well on Pizza, noting that it seemed like he was bitten by the spider.

Au'lun cuts a flap of skin from the dead spider while Nero attempts to harvest some poison. This will take about 15 or so min and I don't think you have something to store it in 🤔

Enyawd, you cut Pizza free from the spider's webbing and drag him back into the room laying him against the wall.

Tova and Arden, with your medicine check you are able to tell that between the bite and the poison of this spider, Pizza is no longer with the living... His insides has started to liquefy and within hours he will burst open leaving nothing but a messy slob.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 6:12 PM

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 6:37 PM
Arden, standing solemnly by Pizza's lifeless form, speaks softly, his voice carrying the weight of the forest's ancient wisdom. "In the ebb and flow of the cosmos, Zivara teaches us that all life is a cycle, an eternal loop of birth, death, and rebirth. As you depart from this mortal coil, may your spirit find solace in Zivara's embrace. Your journey here concludes, yet beyond, the dance of life beckons anew. Rest now, dragon friend, until we meet again." His words, infused with a deep reverence for life's perpetual rhythm, offers a final farewell.

Do you have 4 sorcery points 🤔 isn't is only 3 😂

Adding chain mail may affect stealth checks 🤷‍♂️

Toombz — Today at 10:22 AM
I've got a solution for that don't worry
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:44 AM
He already has chain mail, the Blessing of the Forge basically just ads a +1 to it... so it's not a new item, just actually an enhancement, but you can't override an items stats
I will be slightly slow on the Play by Post for the next few days. With financial year end etc. we are extremely busy and I also have a game tonight and then going to the dnd event tomorrow night so I will be very slow on response.

I am not sure 🤔 but look forward to hearing your solution and seeing  if it will work 🤭
Toombz — Today at 12:23 PM
All will be revealed soon. And now that I think about it, Dumbledick won't be right behind Nero anymore. He'll hang back a distance of no more than 120ft and encourages anyone else who wears chain mail armour and has disadvantage on stealth checks to hang back too.
Toombz — Today at 1:23 PM
Is being 70-80ft behind the more stealthy people enough to ensure that our armour will not affect their stealth checks? Or will we need to be a greater distance away?
Image
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:52 PM
lol, think that depends on how bad your roll is? 350ft+ if you're wearing armor and roll a 1 xD
Toombz — Today at 2:06 PM
Maybe.. Because if I'm not mistaken, if we're 70-80ft away, our armour won't affect the stealth profile of the other party members especially if both group are actively trying to be quiet. The armour wearers will always have disadvantage on their stealth checks, I just don't want our fails to affect the stealth of the group who don't have heavy armour
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:09 PM
Then don't wear such clanky amour😂.....Whats worse failing a save or being separated? Especially in dungeons where stealth is key and and ambush could split us and make us vulnerable
Toombz — Today at 3:11 PM
I'll stick with the clanky armour thanks🤣 I value protection more than I do stealth checks
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:12 PM
You're one of the tanks the whole point is to have you up front to take any surprise damage that would otherwise squish the others.
Toombz — Today at 3:12 PM
But you're the tank now. You have 20 AC 🦾🦾
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:17 PM
Hence why I said one of the tanks. What if I were to go down like pizza and there you are jogging behind for atleast 2 rounds like a chonky kid in full football gear like wait for me kinda thing😂....if anything we should be waaaaay infront that way the quicker dextrose of us can run up for a flank while us tanks take the damage as distractions. But hey what's that you were saying about being afraid? 😂 
Toombz — Today at 3:22 PM
I'm not afraid.. I'm just being considerate for group stealth and also, the group might not care about stealth and say as long as we're together, we're good. With you as tank and Peridot as a damage beast for muscle, you can handle anything that comes your way. Bottom line is I'm not getting rid of my armour and I doubt Tova is either. Also, if danger does arise for you guys, Tova and I each have Spells that reach 60ft away so we can intervene in the same round even if it takes 2 rounds to get to you guys. Also, that's if the group even cares about stealth at all
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:22 PM
Suuure😂👌
Toombz — Today at 3:26 PM
You're the one that sounds pretty scared now hey?🤣 "let's stick together as a group at all times please" whereas I'm cool with hanging back even on my own if necessary. Who sounds scared now?🤣🤣
My position is simple: we stick together always unless stealth is needed then we split up unless the group doesn't care about stealth. Then we continue sticking together
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:31 PM
Not at all🤣 I know I can take a hit and not afraid to get hit either so I'm good just curious why bother with such a good AC if you're hiding in the back...I enjoy getting up in the mess and having the thrill of 1 or 2 bad rolls could turn the tides completely 
Toombz — Today at 3:36 PM
Awesome, then you'll be part of the group that doesn't care about stealth, same as me. But others may wanna try being stealthy first and avoid trouble rather than just saying screw stealth let's just fight (which is my attitude by the way I'm fight first and ask questions later).
Toombz — Today at 4:03 PM
So just out of curiosity @Setto Kaiba, are people with noisy armour okay being 35+ feet away from the others in order to not affect their stealth profile or do they need to be 70+ feet away? Or neither because maybe you'll say 350ft🤣🤣

Fully agreed🤣🤣🤣
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:02 AM
Slightly shook by Pizza's death, you continue forward into the hallway, lead by Nero, his shield glowing with the light from Tova's spell.

Nero, you edge forward keeping your shield above you should anything else jump out. As you get closer to the end of the hallway you look up seeing a long shaft probably created by flowing water and desolving stone, leading up and out onto the mountain beyond. The shaft itself is covered by massive spider webs, yet they seem quite...you do not detect any movement.

As you step out of the hallway, you are back on the forest floor and infront of you a small camfire with a  single Goliath sitting enjoying a meal...
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:48 AM
Seeing the Goliath Nero stops dead his tracks while the others catch up. Then in silence he would like to alert the others that there's a person up ahead before cautiously approaching
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 10:05 AM

Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:39 AM
@Tiny / MrFarmy What does Tiny Look like and what would Nero be able to tell about his personality 🤔
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 10:40 AM
Enyawd looks at the goliath... "I thought we just lost an oaf?"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 10:45 AM
(Am I seeing them at this point or am I still unaware of them)
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:49 AM
You will see Nero emerge from the hallway looking at you...perhaps nit the rest of the groupnas yet since they are still in the hallway.
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 11:01 AM
Nero would see a chubby 340lb Goliath sitting next to a camp fire roasting a piece of meat that looks like the hind of a rabbit. He is dripping some red liquid over the rabbit using it as a marinade while humming a tune and whistling to himself, the goliath looks like he is in high spirits and doesn't have a worry in the world, when suddenly the goliath looks up and spots him, the Goliath quickly places his hand on the hilt of the maul tucked into his belt on his left hip and shouts "Hi friend" The goliath waves and smiles from ear to ear "Are you friend? Are you Hungry friend? I have meat"
(The goliath is literally is waving and smiling like this)
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:04 AM
Enyawd, hearing this, rushes to the front and asks: "Ale... Do you have ale?"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 11:08 AM
"Oh another friend, Hi other friend! No I do not have any ale unfortunately" 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:18 AM
Enyawd mutters something in Dwarvish that would make Tova gasp if she heard it, while stomping away
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 11:22 AM
(The goliath would like to know what Enyawd mutters as he too speaks reads and writes dwarven 😝 )
(Say it... dew eet)
Toombz — Today at 11:24 AM
@Enyawd Nightbeard you're in trouble
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:30 AM
Clearly not good enough to know it's Dwarvish
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 11:38 AM
The goliath upon hearing the dwarfs remark gets an expression of shock on his face and proceeds to stand up, and in doing so you are now able to see this goliath is much larger than your regular goliaths standing at an enormous 8'2" the goliath replies to the dwarfs remark "You are not a nice person, you are not friend, I do not want to share with you anymore" 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:57 AM
Enyawd isn't fussed. "Ale... That's what I want. Not friends... Friends always leave". His expression changes slightly, but only for a brief moment before he continues... "So what you not sharing then? I've seen bigger legs on a midget dwarf"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:11 PM
Nero grabs Enyawd by the shoulder firmly as he adresses the stranger while he swoops his auburn hair out of his eyes. "Good day friend ...please forgive my stout companion here his going through withdrawals and after the ordeal we just faced we could all do with a stiff beverage" Nero says as he lights a smoke..... 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:28 PM
@Tiny / MrFarmy" we don't have much to trade for your kind offer. We have lost many of our companions during our perilous journey through this dungeon. We won't be a bother lad we just want rest a minute and pay our respects before we depart on our quest to finally rid this land of its plight of the gobbos"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 12:51 PM
The goliath looks at this strange being in front of him not knowing whether to trust him or not but for now he will give this creature the benefit of the doubt "Oh no, I am sorry to hear of your loss, I have also known loss and I do not like the feeling it stirs within me, please sit down help yourselves to some meat there's not much but you can share in whatever there is (You're looking at the half rabbit roasting over the fire with this dark red liquid glazed over it, the outside looks sticky yet the skin underneath looks almost crispy and the smell is sweet and smokey from the glazing that is just a tad singed by the flames) I hope you like rabbit, oh and the glazing is just some of the sweet berries in the area that I've mashed into a juice to marinade the meat." 

Tiny sits back down, "I will leave you to your pay your respects but after I sure would love to hear about this perilous journey you just had through this dungeon, I haven't heard a good story in weeks, and if I may ask where are you from as I've never seen anyone like you before, what are you if I may be so bold to ask?" 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 2:03 PM
Ae'lun peeks out to see whats happening, and upon noticing Tiny runs up in wonder "woah! did your mother plant your feet in shit? You're massive! I bet you could fist fight an owlbear! Well met, the names Ae'lun"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 2:11 PM
Tiny looks at Ae'lun and laughs "Oh another one, hello friend, mama didn't do that, why are you blue?" and he continues laughing a little.
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 2:50 PM
Ae'lun looks at his hands in a panic "I am!? What did you guys do to me last night!"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 3:08 PM
(Are you not blue? I'm going of your profile pic your character is blue 🤣 )
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:11 PM
Noticing the concern he bursts out laughing "worry not. it was the gods that made me blue, not the company I keep"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 5:17 PM
"Your kindness and generosity will not be forgotten big fella. Oh me? The Names Nero and I'm a tortle from the humble house of Ebérloch he chuckles before slowly going  somber....we aren't many but a proud people...many of my kin where hunted to near extintion I the last great war of the coasts....prized for our shells as shields we were slaughtered without mercy with only a few elders and young lines escaping to carry on our legacy....but alas ...i digress😅...." he accepts the welcome and sits by the fire tummy growling."so what brings a big ol giant such as yourself to this cosy neck of the woods
Toombz — Today at 5:33 PM
Dumbledick, seeing that his new hombres have not started trying to rip the giant's head off and even laughing with him in addition to him waving like a happy go lucky child, makes his way over to the gathering and introduces himself to the new guy. 

"Names Dumbledick. He with the dick that dumbles. I don't quite know what that name means but the ladies gave it to me so you'll have to ask them. What is your name big guy and what brings you to this part of the woods?"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 5:52 PM
Tiny first responds to Arden "Hello friend Arden, wow you speak funny, and my guddersnhups there are a lot of you. My name is Tiny, and I don't know how the rabbit died, I found it some ways back next to the road already dead, it wasn't dead long and looked like it was attacked by a wolf or a fox maybe, but Mama always said not to waste what can sustain life, and don't worry I cleaned it real good before I put it on the roast" While saying this Tiny sucks off some of the berry juice still on his fingers.

Tiny then turns to Nero, "A tortle, that's a funny word, I am sorry that your kind was hunted tortle friend, that does not sound nice at all, and I'm not sure what I'm doing here really just the way life has brought me, I'm a bit over here then a bit over there I just go wherever the road takes me really"

Tiny then proceeds to listen to Dumbledicks introduction and his cheerful demeanour changes to something almost sad "Hello friend" he then pouts and folds his arms tight around him "Can I call you something else, I don't like that word, that word hurts people, that is a bad word, its never nice to call someone dumb, did your papa not like you too? Did these ladies hear your papa call you dumb?"
Toombz — Today at 5:57 PM
I don't know, and it doesn't bother me. Strength is the only thing that matters in this world. Everything else is a delusion for the week. There's only one certainty in life, a strong man stands above and conquers all! So name-calling is not a concern. I seek strength because violence is the only language that evil understands. Anyways, hope you've been having a good day"

As Dumbledick proceeds to sit down and begin forging Grapple Guns from the ropes he has with the fire being used to cook rabbit/whatever
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 6:00 PM
Tiny looks at Dumbledick with just a blank face "I'll just call you friend person until something more suitable comes around"
Toombz — Today at 6:27 PM
"Apologies... I have seen a great deal of death and destruction in my 18 years of age nearly half of which I have spent fighting wars and forging weapons to fight wars. I'll grow on you eventually"

As Dumbledick goes silent and continues forging his grapple guns with a blank look on his face. Everyone seeing he is deep in thought but not knowing what is on his mind
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 6:35 PM
A wave of relief washes over Arden as the giant explained the rabbit's natural end, reinforcing the cycle of life that Zivara and her followers hold so dear. He nods in understanding. "Well met, my friend," Arden continues, his initial concern giving way to the kinship of shared values. "I am called Arden, your mother's wisdom aligns with the very tenets of life that guide my path. She must have been a wonderful woman and seems to have bestowed the best of teachings in her young." His eyes, reflecting the verdant hues of the forest, meet with the giant's with an approving warmth as he inquires further, "Tell me more about your reverence for the natural world, my sizable friend?" 
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 6:44 PM
Tiny looks a little stunned at what he just heard "Arden you use big words, but yes, mama was wonderful and I loved mama, and I miss mama, but mama is gone, but one day I will see mama again when this world has no more need for me."
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 8:27 PM
Tiny looks very confused by what Arden just said "You're silly, mama will never fit inside a tree, and the only air mama ever had came out her backside. And who is Zivara, is she another friend I still have to meet?"
Toombz — Today at 9:07 PM
Dumbledick, after briefly snapping out of his war PTSD flashbacks, has been meaning to ask @Deformiter (Arden) something 

"Arden my good friend. I do not wish to be rude, but I have noticed that you love walking around with that tree branch which looks like a future home for birds or something. I admire your dedication to nature and it's creatures so much so that you carry this stick everywhere you go, but we're on a mission to fight countless Goblins and no offense, we don't have time for useless bird sanctuaries. Want me to lend you my newly acquired Mace of Terror? Or how about my Sword of Life Stealing? I assure you they will be of more use than that bird shelter
Image
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:14 PM
Toombz — Today at 9:19 PM
"What??? I am only trying to help. That tree branch looks like it is complete and ready to be planted into the ground and have some lovely little birds of the forest living in it, but now is the time to get serious. Really, what value does the stick hold to us other than maybe being used as wood for a fire and even so, it would barely provide enough wood to cook a rat"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:21 PM
He worked hard on that "bird sanctuary "
Toombz — Today at 9:22 PM
"And I gave him praise for how lovely it is in appearance and is ready to fulfil its destiny as a 5 star residence of a squirrel or bird family I need of shelter. I salute him for that"
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 9:24 PM
He's quite capable with it if you aren't happy with your equipment I'm sure they'd fetch a pretty penny
Toombz — Yesterday at 9:30 PM
"I am very happy with the equipment. I am simply offering to arm one of our comrades with something of use during our quest to eradicate the goblins. It is as my old lieutenant told me when I was 9 years old and he saw me playing with toys of mine which he then proceeded to break:
 "Kid, if it is not forged for war, it is for the birds" and that staff looks as though it LITERALLY is for the birds. Or am I wrong Arden?" 
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:32 PM
Arden, with a patient smile, turns to Tiny, his voice as soft as a gentle breeze through the leaves. "Tiny, my friend, Zivara isn't someone we meet as we do in the flesh. She's like the air we breathe and the ground beneath our feet. Imagine Zivara as a great tree, her roots deep in the earth, branches stretching wide into the sky. Everything around us, the trees, the animals, even us, we're all part of her. When your mama left, she didn't leave you alone; she became part of everything around us, watched over by Zivara, forever a part of this great, living tapestry."

He then turns to Dumbledick, his gaze calm but filled with a quiet strength. "And as for my staff, dear Dumbledick, it's far more than it appears. This Staff of the Woodlands, it's a conduit of nature's own power. With it, I can awaken creatures to aid us, speak with animals, even command the plants to entangle our foes. Its magic can shield us, hide us and yes, even create sanctuary for birds if needed. Its power comes not from the force it can exert in battle, but from the harmony it brings to us and the natural world. So, while I appreciate your offer, this 'tree branch' is exactly what I need on our mission to protect and serve the balance of nature."
Toombz — Yesterday at 9:39 PM
Dumbledick is shocked at what he has just heard. 

"You mean to tell me that the Twiggy Twirler can do all of that? Well tickle my balls!! That staff sounds mighty powerful indeed and not for the birds at all. It's just that I have never seen it in action before. When you say awaken creatures to aid us, do you mean bring dead creatures back to life to aid us? Because that sounds so cool!! Or do you mean if we catch like a T-Rex asleep, you can wack it over the head to wake up with the staff and it will be under your command? Also cool!!" 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Yesterday at 9:41 PM
Enyawd comments "didn't help us much in there... Can you ask one of your furry friends to fetch us some ale? I'd even settle for mead..."
Toombz — Yesterday at 9:45 PM
"You know what, I also feel the need for some Ale to celebrate this terrific discovery. Perhaps Arden was simply not given the opportunity to demonstrate these great abilities before but now that I know about them, I seek to know more. Can we get Ale and drink to this mighty weapon"

Side note: really loving the role play today🙂‍↔️ 
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:51 PM
Arden, with the embodiment of patience and wisdom of an elder, addresses his companions with a light chuckle, the sound mingling with the rustling leaves around them. "Ah, if only your eyes and ears were as keen in observation as they are in jest," he muses, glancing towards Enyawd. "This staff, has been a recent addition to my arsenal, I only crafted it the night before Burdok's departure from our realm, while I ensured that you got a good nights rest after our battle with the Wraith. Its magic, has therefore been untouched by our trials and awaits its moment."

"And Dumbledick, 'awaken' does not reanimate the dead nor bend the will of creatures such as a T-Rex. It's a spell of gentle coaxing, a nudge towards consciousness for trees and beasts alike, granting them the gift of awareness and speech. They will become my companions for no less than 30 days, whereafter they will be given their own freewill to live out their days as sentient beings, guided by their own newly found intelligence."

"As for the ale you seek, while my staff is indeed powerful, summoning beverages is a task better suited to a tavern." His eyes, sparkling with a hint of mischief.
Toombz — Yesterday at 9:59 PM
"I know that look Arden😏!! Who is keen to head to a tavern then? Perhaps I may fetch a good price for my weapons as Nero suggested and perhaps attain the Plate Armour I so deeply desire from a marketplace nearby the tavern? Pretty please? It will also give us a great opportunity to get to know each other and.. Sorry didn't get your name big guy @Tiny / MrFarmy? I'm guessing it's mountain? Or giant fortress?"🤣🤣 
Pretty please can we go to a tavern with an armory nearby? Then we can maybe get a new creature as an ally and see what Arden's staff can really do like a Giant Ape or a T-Rex!! The Goblin empire would fall within a day!!" 
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 10:05 PM
Tiny looks at Dumbledick "Oh I wish I had such a mighty name, Mama always said when I was a babe I could fit into one of papas boots, that is how Tiny I was, and that is why she named me Tiny"
Toombz — Yesterday at 10:09 PM
"Tiny?" Exclaims Dumbledick as he begins laughing at how unfitting a name it is for him. 

"Apologies, but your name does not suit you at all. You are a tower, and from what I gather, you are a great warrior. I can always tell if someone can handle themselves in battle and you seem the part. So are you keen on joining us on our mission to rid this place of the Goblin tyranny?"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 10:11 PM
Tiny laughs a little too "I guess I am not as tiny as I was, and I do love to eat, but please tell me, what did the goblins do that was so evil that you would want to hunt them?"
Toombz — Yesterday at 10:17 PM
"Well you bring up a very good question. I was told that the goblins are terrorizing the locals here and that this fine group of individuals were tasked with dealing with them. 

But we had a Goblin not so long ago that we were torturi... eh hem.. Sorry, I meant questioning, and he said that the locals have been killing them, and stealing their habitat and making the goblin's lives miserable and so if that's true, then perhaps the locals are the bad guys. So I'm a bit torn about this new information & its authenticity but I've been keeping it to myself to be honest. Mostly following everyone's lead here. So anyways, are you in? Have I convinced you?" 
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 10:22 PM
"Erm, yeah I guess I can join you guys, you all seem friendly and I have been very lonely in my travels lately, no one to talk to or play with or cook for, I know papa didn't like me very much but he always liked my cooking." Tiny looks at the rabbit still on the roast and kind of feels a bit rejected that no one has eaten any of it, he is quite hungry but has already decided that the group need sustenance more than he does. "But I think we should know if the goblins are really bad shouldn't we? It would not be right to hurt them if they aren't bad"
Toombz — Yesterday at 10:27 PM
"Perhaps.. But my general experience with goblins during my wars in my early teens is that they generally tend to fight on the side of evil because their actions are driven by malice and greed so I'm pretty sure these goblins most probably are evil too. But I suppose along the way we could try and find out if the goblins are telling the truth or not. Miracles do happen so there may be such a thing as a good goblin" 
Dumbledick says as he begins to chuckle which leads to huge laughter at the thought of a good goblin existing 
"I should also mention that the goblins were in cahoots with a wraith which are entities created from dark energies and so the goblins were in bed with evil. Though now that I look back, the wraith was once an honorable knight and he maintained his honour right till the end and honour is not something that evil tends to have. So I am highly conflicted, but I assume my allies want to keep the word they made to the locals and keep fighting the Goblins. What say ye Arden, Ae'lun and crew?" 
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 10:49 PM
Ae'lun sits on the floor near the fire and looks back towards the hole they just crawled out of "while its great to breathe real air again, I can't help but feel that for a "goblin supply post" we saw neither a great deal of goblins nor supplies"
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:07 PM
"Very true. This deepens the mystery a little bit. Also, where are the hundreds of goblins that the one we interrogated spoke about? Lots of unanswered questions which makes me crave the ale that @Enyawd Nightbeard spoke about even more!"
Toombz — Today at 12:26 AM
Summary for those who don't wanna read through everything:
Arden, Nero, Enyawd, Ae'lun and Dumbledick went up and introduced themselves to Tiny. 

Nero wants to perform a burial ritual for Pizza.

Arden explained to a curious Dumbledick that his "useless bird-sanctuary stick" was an extremely powerful staff that can create new intelligent allies for us from existing beasts and plants. Dumbledick wants to test out the staff out by using it on a very powerful beast like a T-Rex or Giant Ape so we can make short work of any goblins we encounter.

Enyawd wants Ale and so Dumbledick suggests they head to a tavern after a passing statement by Arden. He believes it's a good way to socialize and get to know each other. He also suggests they visit an armory nearby the tavern so he can sell one of his weapons and maybe buy everyone who wants Plate Armour.

Tiny wonders why we're going after the goblins to which Dumbledick explains that the locals say the goblins are terrorizing them but the Goblin the group interrogated said that humans have terrorized them while taking their habitat so there is now an uncertainty of who the actual bad guys are. Tiny wants to be certain the goblins are bad but will join us in battling them.

Ae'lun notes "for a supply post, we saw neither a great deal of goblins nor supplies". 

I hope that's short enough😬 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:12 AM
Personally not a fan of the summary - I suggest everyone read what took place to pick up on any subtleties that their characters might engage on/with. (not this summary, all summaries when it comes to D&D) 
Toombz — Today at 1:13 AM
Fair enough.. Then shall I delete the summary and only post it if someone asks?
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:14 AM
no, the summary can stay, no need to remove it. Lots went into typing it, so let's keep it there for anyone who wants to get an idea of what went down, but I do suggest everyone read what took place 🙂
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:15 AM
Enyawd sniffs the air... the sizzling meat drawing him in. "It's not quite a boar, but my stomach, lacking ale, would do well with a snack." 

He takes a deep breath, remembering Patty, Pizza, and Burdok. 

He slightly dips in a bow towards Tiny. "Apologies young'un. We've lost some good friends just now. Apparently our appetite isn't one of them. Could you spare a leg for a hungry dwarf?" 
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 9:50 AM
Tiny looks at Enyawd and frowns, not forgetting the rude words he mumbled earlier in dwarfish "No you are mean, you are not friend, I do not want to share with you, the food is for friends not meanies."
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:58 AM
In response to Enyawd's evident distress from his withdrawals and the group's collective yearning for some semblance of ale to toast their recent revelations, Arden, tapping into the heart of the forest's bounty, gathers herbs, berries, and water. With a gentle touch and a whisper to the earth, he employs Druidcraft, weaving it into the natural ingredients to accelerate the fermentation process, nurturing a mild, naturally brewed drink. 

As he offers the concoction to Enyawd, Arden's eyes glimmer with a mix of camaraderie and solemnity. 'Consider this a humble gift from the forest, Enyawd,' he says softly, 'May it warm your spirit and ease the longing for what's missed, reminding us that even in the darkest woods, there's light and life to be found.'
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 10:03 AM
Tiny's eyes open wide he gets a big smile on his face as you looks at this wonder and softly whispers "Wooow, magic"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Yesterday at 2:51 PM
Enyawd graciously sips the strange mix, not quite ale but pleasant enough to settle the nerves. "Thank you Arden."
Ky — Yesterday at 3:56 PM
Tova, not interested in Making new friends since they just keep dying, will go to Peridot and ask what exactly he saw when he fell through the floor. He had mentioned seeing a cave and Tova thinks it could be a good place to check out 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Yesterday at 4:58 PM
Perhaps Tiny will hold the rope and lower someone down to investigate?
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 5:29 PM
I can shrink who ever? 
If I recall is not very wide so we can maby shrink a dwarf so they can fit?
Ky — Yesterday at 5:42 PM
Tova hasn't shared with you guys though. She just kinda walked away when you all went outside so you wouldn't know her idea currently.

But those are ideas 🙂
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 5:55 PM
Fair...sorry when you mentioned   it it reminded me of when he was down there on the rope. But yeah we can pick up after you catch up
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 7:40 PM
I believe Jarrod is at Ultra so Peridot is hanging in limbo right now... Let us wait until tomorrow and then we can continue and you can decide on going forward or going back in to see if there is anything in the cave 🤷‍♂️
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 11:02 AM
Enyawd will follow his party anywhere after that mild drink
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:34 PM
After taking a few sips of his own drink (assuming he was offered too😅) Nero would like to raise his cup towards the burning glow of the fire. He reflects deeply on the adventure that had just transpired and the faces of his fallen comrads flash across his empty hazy eyes. 

Patty,Pizza and Burdock....


May the almighty Valkyrie welcome you to the Golden halls. May they lead you over the great battlefields one last time and may the sing your names,so we may hear it rise from the depths of Valhalla and know you now feast in your rightful place at the table of kings." 

He cuts his palm and drops some blood into his drink before  tossing it into the fire.

"Great Men have fallen...warriors, brethren....friends........May we never forget"

After enjoying a relaxing meal and a drink of some questionable ale 🍺 what is the party's decision... going on or going back into the cave?
Toombz — Today at 4:19 PM
I vote we go on
Ky — Today at 4:27 PM
Tova wants to go back to the Cave. If this is the goblin outpost and we miss all the goblins, we are not really achieving the goal we came here for. It may be fruitless but Tova would like to make sure
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 5:22 PM
"if we are going to go back in I'd recommend we do so quickly, the pile of corpses we left behind aren't getting any fresher and the air down there was not the freshest when we started"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 5:23 PM
Enyawd sides with the less hairy dwarf
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 5:25 PM
Arden, standing solemnly by his comrades, nods in agreement with Tova's sentiment, recognizing the essence of their quest in the depths of this forest. "Indeed, Tova speaks wisely," Arden begins, his voice resonant with the harmony of the natural world. "Our encounter with the goblins remains unresolved, a chapter yet to be concluded. Let us return to the cavern's shadows, where unanswered questions linger, and perhaps, in its depths, we shall find the clarity and resolution our quest demands."
Toombz — Today at 5:33 PM
It looks like we have a majority🦾 we're going back in 🙌
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 6:04 PM
"there was a hole in the wall we never checked right? the one that Blobuk came running in through" Ae'lun then looks very confused "Bardok... Berdyl... Whatever his name was... he showed up out of nowhere and disappeared just as fast, could have been some kind of weird goblin trick to get us off their tracks"
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 6:10 PM
Tiny just looks at everyone noticing that the other dwarf did not even greet him it is at this moment he calls out to Tova "Hello friend, are you shy? It's okay I won't bite on purpose." Tiny then respond's to Ae'lun "Yes please, eat" Tiny gestures to the roast "Everyone please, have a bite" and he looks at Enyawd "Except you, you are not nice, you don't get a share until you learn to be nice."
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 6:14 PM
Ae'lun takes a plate and his new dagger and slices two pieces off of the rabbit "Here, please. Where I'm from its considered rude to eat before the chef"  he says as he offers a slice to Tiny
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 6:17 PM
Tiny who is kinda hungry thinks a bit, he feels the others should eat because they need the food more, but he also does not want to refuse Ae'lun "Thank you very much" he takes the smaller of the two pieces and eats it. "Mmmmm, that came out better than I even hoped it would, the berries really marinated into the meat and the sweet and sticky goes together so well, please, please eat, tell me what you think" Tiny says while wiping a small bit of drool off his mouth.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 6:19 PM
After wolfing down his portion of food Nero gets up to get ready to move. He thanks tiny" thank you little chef you are most gifted In the craft. I don't speak for the rest but in my opinion...we've learned the hard way that we have a much better chance with strength in numbers so if you'd like you're welcome to tag along we could always use with a big lad such as yourself "
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 6:22 PM
"Errr sure, just gimme a few seconds to pack my things, and we should probably put that fire out."
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 6:26 PM
Ae'lun looks at the rest of the group eating then smiles and takes a bite "delicious!"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 6:46 PM
Enyawd goes back for another round of forest ale
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 6:50 PM

Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:14 PM
The party moves back through the hallway to the room with the sarcophagus and the statue of the knight and then to the passage with illusionary floor... Who is leading the party and what is your plan to get to the cave entrance. The cave entrance being on the other side of this hallway (30ft away and 40ft down).
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:20 PM
Did we get a description what Enyawd saw while he was down there? If it's big enough to venture through I can carry upto 500lbs if a few of the dwarves need to lift down?
He nervously eyes tiny...."sorry lad you're a wee bit big....I may have to make a second trip with you." 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 7:32 PM

I think Peridot saw the cave? Not Enwayd. But he also said it would a tight squeeze. Will Nero fit 🤔 I don't think the shell is squishable to try fit 🫣
Jarrod — Today at 7:44 PM
Yea as far as im aware i am the only one who fell down to see the cave
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:50 PM
Once we're down there I can shrink to about 3ft ish
Unless the tiny ones all go and we chill and wait for them to finish?
Ky — Today at 8:03 PM
Shrinking can work I am sure.
Dm, isn't the cave under the illusioned floor? Or am I making things up now out of confusion 🤔 it was too long ago 🤭
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:28 PM
Jip... this cave is below the illusionary floor...on the other side from where you are now
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 8:29 PM
Doubt theres any way for Tiny to go in there?
Ky — Today at 8:42 PM
No I doubt tiny will fit, but he could help get us down there if he would want to help 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 8:50 PM
So who's going first? 😅
Ky — Today at 8:55 PM
Tova will go first but it sounds like we first need to get back to the other side 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:16 PM
You make your way back and stand facing the hallway with the illusionary floor...what do you do?
Toombz — Today at 9:26 PM
@Setto Kaiba the Goblin we tied up is it still close to us where we left it? In the pit maybe?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:31 PM
He was executed and left on the walkway next to the pit... This was in the room with the pit which is beyond the hallwayd with the illusionary floor and the room with the 6 sarcophagai. 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:45 PM
@Setto Kaiba would I be able to levitate down or is the tunnel shaft to narrow?
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 9:52 PM
wait who killed him😱  was it Arden!?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:53 PM
Infront of you is a 30ft long hallway,  an illusionary floor of 20ft (looks like a floor but is a pit going further down that you can see) and then 10ft of actual floor before going to the previous room.

If you drop off the edge into the illusionary floor on the opposite side (into the darkness) you find a ledge 40ft down. If you stand on this ledge you take 2 steps forward you have to army crawl to squeeze through the opening that goes into the cave there.
Toombz — Today at 9:54 PM
Before you waste your Spell slots, I wanna ask if I can shoot my newly forged grapple gun made from crossbows to shoot to the wall on the other side and sort of just climb there and then slide down the rope? @Setto Kaiba and @Basically_A_Chicken it's best you shoot my crossbow if DM agrees
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:09 PM
So... I will need an explanation as to how you created the grapple gun (i.e. components) 🤔
Toombz — Today at 10:10 PM
I simply added a rope at the end of the arrows fired by my crossbow.. In a nutshell
There may be some other forge-related things I did which I am not privy to but that is the jist of it
Hopefully I'm more successful than this
Image
I also did the same with Pizza's
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:16 PM
There are a couple of logistical issue with forging a "grapple gun"... First is the thickness of the rope vs the thickness of the bolt. With a bolt being 1/2 inch thick and the rope from 1 inch + as hemp rope is made for climbing and thus has ro be extra thick to accommodate additional weight. Second is that the full weight of the rope (especially while rolled up) will weigh down the bolt and make shooting a bolt near impossible.
Toombz — Today at 10:17 PM
Then Levitate it is @Turtlebaff420
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:17 PM
This could potentially work if you have mitral thread due to it's light weight and very thin but strong properties.
Toombz — Today at 10:19 PM
Fair enough.. But what about my mage hand? It could carry the rope and then hammer the rope into solid ground so we could use the rope to reach the other side?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:24 PM
Mage hand is not allowed to make a n attack roll...however I would let you make a d20 roll adding your spell mod against the DC of the rock (17 in this cave)... Yet, you still need to tie the rope to something that can be driven into the ground and a crossbow bolt is too thin for this... 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:25 PM
Keep in mind that you still nees to get to the other side first as Levitate only goes up and down...
Toombz — Today at 10:25 PM
Damn.. Well there goes all my ideas but thanks for the technical clarification 🦾😎
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:27 PM
Good ideas though 💡 Would have been cool 😎
Toombz — Today at 10:28 PM
Would a mace be good enough to tie down the rope with? Not the mace of terror but a regular mace. I believe I still have one from my starting equipment. I know I'd still need to roll a d20 but I wanna just see if it's feasible
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 10:32 PM
Do we have a map of where we are? My brain needs a picture
Toombz — Today at 10:33 PM
The best I can say is we need to go 30ft forward and then 40ft down
That's all my brain needs to know😅
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:34 PM
Yeah... mace is heavy and should have a handle thick enough to carry the rope. Throwing it might still be quite difficult just due to the wight of the rope so DC will be much higher but you could use your mage hand to attempt this 👍

With the mace there might just be a problem of getting it to stay in the rock. Hitting thr rock and causing it to break is one thing... hitting hard enough to make thr mace stay while someone is hanging from it is another 🫣
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 10:35 PM
If theres light I can try make the cross by jumping on the stones but I would need a rope, but then the problem becomes holding the rope on that side😂
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 10:35 PM
Is nero strong enough to carry Tiny accross the 30ft gap? @Turtlebaff420 , Tiny would make a good anchor
Toombz — Today at 10:38 PM
My research may be wrong but I wanna ask: if the mace is 4 lb and the rope is 10lb and my mage hand can carry a total of 10 lb, can't my mage hand carry the mace and the rope (not the whole rope because that would be too heavy, just the end of the rope and drag the remaining 50ft to the other side while leaving the other end of the rope with us?) Would that be feasible and would it reduce the DC needed to pull this off?
Toombz — Today at 10:40 PM
Yep Tiny would definitely be a good anchor

Turtlebaff420
Levitate
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

You could definitely carry the mace with the rope tied to it accross... What is the plan to do with it once there? No check needed

Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet

A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.

You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.

I'm officially out of ideas
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:03 PM
You take a few min to tie your rope to the mace in your backpack. You cast your spell... summoning your spectral hand and it carries your new "grapple hook" over to the opposite side and smacks it into the ground, trying to find enough grip to hold the rope and perhaps a party member... yet as the mace strikes the rock it just breaks little pieces of stone off, not breaking the rock itself.
Your spectral hand just floats back...fingers kinda dragging in shame 🤣
Toombz — Today at 11:04 PM
Except one or two ideas maybe left.. What if we hammered my and Pizza's crossbows into the wall alongside us leading 30 ft forward? Or would they not be heavy enough to hold the weight of someone trying to reach the other side?

Last idea is if @Turtlebaff420 is able to reduce the size of someone, @Basically_A_Chicken Shnuggles could carry Tiny (reduced tiny) to the other side before bringing him back to normal). How about that @Setto Kaiba ? 
If these ideas don't work, then I'm officially out of plans
Or once Tiny is reduced, we could put all of our strength together and throw him to the other side to become our anchor? (It's time for the bad ideas)
Ky — Today at 11:12 PM
Could we not tie a rope around Tiny or someone/s strong and Tova could just kinda drop down? Rope is 50ft and the drop is 40ft? I mean it doesn't have to be Tova, Peridot might be lighter and more nibble but could we not essentially do that. Or use a rope hanging from an anchor point on the solid floor and use levitate to move the Nero space craft up and down? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:12 PM
Idea 1... Would have to get a very high dex roll to be able to make it without breaking.

Idea 2... Snuggles is a small creature and reduce will change a medium creature to a small creature making you the same class (size class)... thus I would say it is highly unlikely that snuggles would be able to carry you.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 11:12 PM

still think this can work, if we just throw the mace over with the rope tied well enough to it. and then it could naturally anchor, like a make-shift grappling hook.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:18 PM
@Setto Kaiba humor me...tiny being a beefy boy....say I were to double his size to say 14 ish feet if he were to drop down being nearly half the size of the drop would he take fall damage if he also had stones endurance active?

Or we could move on to the mountains, this path was locked behind a bunch of puzzles and a wraith. Could the goblins get around all that?

Arden, weary of the prolonged deliberations, decides to act. With a swift invocation of his druidic powers, he casts Spider Climb upon himself. The magic courses through him, granting him the ability to defy gravity. Grasping one end of the rope firmly, Arden ascends gracefully onto the ceiling. Silently, he makes his way across to the other side of the obstacle. Upon reaching the far side, he carefully descends back to the ground, turning to face his companions with a shrug.

You can use my idea to hammer the mace into the ground and tie the rope around that
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:34 PM
Not sure Arden would be particularly good at that though
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
Tiny is wondering if Arden is still holding the rope and what would happen if he suddenly yanks the rope with all his might? 🤔
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
It'll be fine. My mage hand was just too weak to do it because it can only carry 10 lb. You can carry more than 100 lb so hammering is easy
@Setto Kaiba will just confirm
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:35 PM
I'll wait for the DM to call a check for my looking around first and then we will see 🙂
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
There isn't much to tie the rope around... you still have 10ft to go before reaching the room with the 6 sarcophagai... 🤷‍♂️
Unless you think you could tie it around one of the sarcophagai lids you tried using for a doorstop 🤣
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:38 PM
You could try... it's still a DC of 22 to hit... using a D20 roll + your strength  mod.

Might be a little late now, but could we have done spider climb on tiny, who hold the rope while standing upside down on the ceiling, and then yall just run and swing across?
Like dis?
Also peeps, keep in mind, if its this hard to get to the other side, and there's nothing down there, how do we all get back up and out of the cave again?
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
Perhaps if the persons weight didn't exceed his carry capacity it might be possible 🤣
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:44 PM
Arden feels the weight of decision upon him. Without a word, he ties the rope loosely around his waist. Then, with the grace inherent to those deeply attuned to the natural world, he calls upon his Wild Shape ability. His form shifts, growing larger and more powerful, until he stands as a Draft Horse, majestic and strong. The rope now secured by his equine form, he steadies himself, ready to maintain tension and balance.
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:45 PM
@Setto Kaiba I've got it! We tie two ropes together, which would make 100ft and then tie it to Arden while he's a horse at the bottom of the 40 ft drop?
Tiny / MrFarmy — Yesterday at 11:45 PM
Tiny makes a comment about Arden, "Is that a horse or an ass?"

With Tiny and Horsey Arden and the rest of the party at the top holding the rope you start to decend into the darkness, however even with your darkvision it is difficult to see, yet you make it to the ledge. However just as you are about to pull yourself up, your hand slips and you start to fall backwards, but luckily with a little coaching from Dumbledick on hiw to safely scale the wall you are able to grab hold and pull yourself up...

No you don't anymore. We've decided that since Arden is a horse that can stick on walls, he'll just carry us on his back and we will tie people to him in order for him to give us a lift 30ft forward and 40ft down
Tiny / MrFarmy — Today at 12:51 PM

Maybe you'll be able to put in a hand and pull Tova back.. But it's fine. We'll have to get someone down there. Any volunteers? Dumbledick has a -1 strength modifier so it wouldn't be wise for him to go down
Toombz — Today at 12:53 PM
Fair enough
Peridot has great dexterity but I'm guessing here we need muscle.. Or maybe we just need to dig the opening and make it bigger than way we can all more easily fit in and get Tova out too. @Ky @Setto Kaiba what do you say?

Arden in Draft Horse form stands at the edge of the ledge, surveying the activities in the expanse below him and lets out a snort "prrffftt".
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:14 PM
Tova, with peridot behind you pushing and trying to get your armor unstuck but actually pushing in all the wrong areas 🫣 and you trying to get yourself unstuck by trying to squeeze as much as you can you manage to get yourself free and on the other side, however you manage to break off a piece of the rock as your armor scrapes over it making it impossible for Peridot to follow 🤦‍♂️ After inching forward for a bit you are finally able to stand up. With your darkvision you are able to see a room equal in size to the room with the 6 sarcophagai above and about 20ft high... This room seems to be filled with stuff, but without light you aren't able to tell much more.
Jarrod — Today at 2:22 PM

You cast light on Peridot's staff and also on your warhammer... Walking forward slighly to get a better view, you see a lrage room 60ft by 60ft about filled with a bunch of weapons, food supplies some crates, some barrels etc. On the other end of the room you see a 5ft hallway leading out (down)...

Peridot, now having light here for the first time you are able to look down into thew pit below... it goes down about another 40ft that you can see and then just more darkness below...
Jarrod — Today at 4:18 PM
Before going down further anything interesting in the barrels or weapons, maybe a some gauntlets/bracers
Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:20 PM
You are still on the other side, not able to fit through the opening now that Tova has scraped her armor causing a stone to shift and partially seal it off.
Jarrod — Today at 4:22 PM
aight further down slowly i go
Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:25 PM
You slide down further until you reach the end of the rope... with your light you can see some sharp edged rocks  (natural rocks) sticking out at the bottom about 40ft below  as part of the normal formations of the cave with the cave still continuing well betond this point.

Dumbledick would like to come down with Arden's assistance and try tunnel through where Tova squeezed through so he has enough space to go through without problems and if there's anything in his way, blast it away with sacred flame?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 5:23 PM
Arden, still in his majestic draft horse form, with a clever gesture, invites Dumbledick to climb onto his back, ensuring he holds tight to avoid any mishaps during the maneuver. Then, with the grace and balance only a creature of the forest could possess, he traverses down the side of the cliff face, each step calculated and precise despite his size. As he reaches a position parallel to Peridot, Arden turns his head sideways, his face right next to Peridot's in a moment of silent camaraderie and a hint of mischief in his eyes, a light-hearted attempt to ease the gravity of their quest with a brief moment of levity.
Ky — Yesterday at 5:44 PM
Tova will shout to Peridot, telling him what she sees. And then she would like to investigate a bit closer to see if there are maybe any plans or anything relating to them raiding the towns.

And then she would like to head towards the hallway at the  other end and see if she can hear or see anything there
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 6:44 PM
Dumbledick... carried over by Arden will try and squish in next to Peridot, the two of you now packed in like sardines hanging halfway on the edge of this ledge...

Enyawd, going back outside you find yourself on a small hillside overlooking a low open marshland and in the distance a large mountain range... Lookinga at this you estimate another 2 or 3 days worth of travel to reach the mountain range. The sun is hidden behind a dark cloud and a storm is brewing in the distance...

Tova... walking around inside, you find a couple of things. Looking through some of the crates and the barrels you find...

1 x pouch with 300gp

6 x gemstones worth (50gp each)

1 x Map with markings showing this tomb and a cave in the mountains (same mountains Enyawd saw)

120 days of rations (dried fruit, hard tack etc.)

Some normal (non magical) weapons

Some clothing items

Some dried herbs
If Tiny is not on that side... what is the rope tied to?
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:30 PM
With the angle and the fact that Peridot and Dumbledick is innthe way I'd say it wouldn't be possible to  kick it 🤷‍♂️

Toombz — Yesterday at 10:36 PM

So currently we have both Dumbledick and Peridot on the ledge and Arden starting to realize that we would have to get back or would not have enougb time to get both to safety
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:45 PM
The attack was at disadvantage because you are hanging on a ledge and trying to attack a rock in a crevasse... not able to swing with full strengh.

I will go back. But before I do, I'd like to quickly speak with Tova by sending her a Message with the Message Spell ID she's in range

transmutation cantrip. (Artificer, Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)
Duration: 1 round
Description
You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper that only you can hear.

You can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn't have to follow a straight line and can travel freely around corners or through openings.

She is
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:48 PM
No worries dude... 👍
Toombz — Yesterday at 10:48 PM
@Ky please let us know your situation. Do you see another opening on your side that we can come through to get you? What are you seeing there?
@Jarrod after I get picked up, do you wanna come back too or are you gonna try hit the wall to create an opening one more time?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 11:06 PM
I could try it yes
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:16 PM
Then I guess you'd roll with disadvantage a strike with your staff or something like @Setto Kaiba did with me. Unless you wanna wait first for him to confirm? I'd say roll and he'll accept or reject when he next replies🤷‍♂️
But that's just me

At this point Arden will scale back up the cliff face and go horse around with the others.

Tova will pocket the coin and gem stones. She will take the map and if there is a spear, she will take that. If there isn't a spear, she would like to look for the longest stick/weapon/thing she can find. 

Tova will cast light on whatever object she may find and use it to poke at the water, firstly to try gage the depth of the water, Secondly to see if anything jumps out at her or attacks the spear. Does the light in the water show anything under the murky depths 🤔

Can she see passed the water if there is a way out or is she currently just seeing the water?
Ky — Today at 12:08 AM
Tova will turn around and gasp loudly at the unexpected voice she hears, expecting to see her enemy. Realising that it's a party member, she will curse loudly before replying

'I have found what seems to be a store room, weapons, food, clothes and such. There is a hallway covered in water. Investigating now, don't have more info currently'
Toombz — Today at 12:11 AM
Dumbledick will relay this info to Peridot as Arden is about to whisk him away and then will tell the others too
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:41 AM
You take the items and move on. Using the spear you found in the room you poke around in the water in search of anything that would tell you more, however the water itself is quite dark in colour and you can't see much past the surface. You  stick the spear in until it is completely submerged and still does not fell the bottom leading you to believe the stairs head down much further than the 10ft reach of your weapon. (Not straight down, but like following the stairs down).

As Arden feels his wildshape wearing off he informs Peridot that would he like to try and break through he would not be able to go back with Arden in time and would have to climb out himself... With that knowledge... do you still want to try and break through?

"As Arden feels his wildshape wearing off he informs Peridot that would he like to try and break through he would not be able to go back with Arden in time and would have to climb out himself... With that knowledge... do you still want to try and break through?"

Did you mean to mention Dumbledick in there somewhere? 😅
Ky — Today at 1:09 PM
Tova will take some time and remove her armor after having made sure that nothing in the room is going to attack her. She will put her gear at the top of the stairs and the using the spear, walk down the stairs until she's about half submerged. She will splash in the water trying to attract anything that may be lurking in the depths. Then she will step back a few steps and wait to see if anything attacks.

If all is quiet, she will fully submerge and swim, spear in hand to figure out where the water leads and if it is a viable way out
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:12 PM
Judging by the mesasage earlier...⁠🦉play-by-post⁠... it would seem that he already left and Peridot stayed behind or atleast would be the second one to leave.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:15 PM
Swimming down about 30ft, following the stairs, you see another set of stairs leading up to your right and your left and then forward another 30ft or so you see an iron gate...
Ky — Today at 1:19 PM
Can Tova open the gate?
