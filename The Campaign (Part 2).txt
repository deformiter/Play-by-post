Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Cool... What is the party's plan?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Im also wondering
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Peridot will walk to the stairs stealthy to try and get a view of what could lay below.
this wouldve happened before the smashing of boxes but if we past that then its okay
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:20 PM
Going with a torch?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:21 PM
noooo bad idea
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:24 PM
Heading down the stairs into the room below... you wouldn't be able to see much more of the room than you previously did as it is quite dark, especially since the pit is 100ft deep (that you know of)
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:26 PM
or ill take a caltrop and ask tova to cast light on it and throw it down the stairs but have it covered in my robes till i get to the stairs
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:32 PM
Arden follows closely behind Peridot, melding into the shadows with practiced ease. Leveraging his darkvision and his connection to nature, he scans for roots that might betray the presence of nearby threats. His hands lightly brush against the stone walls and grab hold of the nearest root he can find, sensing for the subtlest disturbances that could indicate danger.
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:33 PM
or that I too have darkvision
Ky — Yesterday at 9:35 PM
Are you guys moving back towards the room with the pit and the goblins we left behind?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
Yea to the stairs we got attacked after the spears
Burger — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
I have dark vision, I see up to 60 feet in the dark but in grays and blacks
What does the room look like?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 9:41 PM
I'll put out my lantern, with Shnuggles flying behind me. I'll try my best to follow the group in the dark once again
Ky — Yesterday at 9:43 PM
Tova will suggest that she goes first, as the one in heavy armor, so that she can cast fog cloud (2nd lvl) on the wall with the holes so that hopefully the goblins can't see us move past and even if they hear us, attacks should be at disadvantage. We won't be able to explore but maybe move passed and see what is next... Though that does have it's own risks. We could run into an ambush considering they know we are there and have had time to figure out their own plan of action
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
Arden heard Tova and nods his head in agreement, moving out of the way to let her past him.
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
"Just a quick scout ahead I can get out real quick, in and out just to get some intel"
Burger — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
Do when know what is in the pit?
We*
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
Arden looks around and waits for the rest of the group to decide what they want to do, he's perfectly comfortable hidden with his Mask of the Wild
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:50 PM
We were just right now between the door and those black boxes. Now we are attempting to go right, toward the "mostly unknown" area, which is the pit, there's a thin ledge on either side of the pit. Where those dashed lines are, there were holes in the walls, where goblins attacked us with poison spears.

This was the map Ae'lun drew with a stick on the floor 😄
Burger — Yesterday at 9:52 PM
Dumb idea but can't we like use the pelt of the big boars  as a disguise and scare the goblins away? 😂
Burger — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
Patty gives Ae'lun a pat on the back 😂
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
'Psst Arden lets go scout' Peridot will say to Arden just wanting to grab intel. PS this is a whisper
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:56 PM
Arden, whispers in agreement, noting that the rest of the party seems to be keen to hang back for a bit, we need some more information, our party will make a lot of noise unintentionally and we could risk falling into another trap
Ky — Yesterday at 9:58 PM
Wait, the fog cloud is a sphere which means we will have to walk through it too. But if I cast it on one side of the pit to obscure the vision of the goblins that would be 'shooting' arrows at us, and then we crawl along the other edge so we are under the hole height, we could get across but we still don't know what is on the other side
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:00 PM
Arden decides to meditate on it and see if Zivara might have some answers.
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:01 PM
Sorry everyone what did I miss....170+ messages😂

Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 10:08 PM
could I send Shnuggles ahead with Arden and Peridot to check things out?
or would you rather he hang back?
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
Nero obviously took what he could from the boars as they make some of the tastiest biltong in all the planes
He would also like to cast blade ward on his shell again @Setto Kaiba
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:18 PM
Is he stealthy? or will he be flap flap flapping? 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:21 PM
Sure... after killing the boars 🐗 you spend the next hour while Nero skins and cuts up the boar and Patty helps to construct a door...

Arden would like to use his druidic abilities (and "Keen Senses"), feeling the earth around them, taking hold of some roots and using the interconnectedness of nature to find nearby enemies.

You make it all the way to end.... turn left and make it to the hallway on the other end of the pit...when you hear this scratching sound and looking back you see this dwarf clumsily trying to crawl closer 😂

Arden and Peridot, reaching the other side you see infront of you a 30ft hallway about 10ft wide and 60ft high...
Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
Looking back "Shh be careful, maybe wait here for a sec. Arden lets go"

Peridot and Arden... looking into the room, you see...

6 sarcophagai 3 to your left and 3 to your right... in the middle of the room is an altar made of marble and at the back is a huge tree recessed into the wall and growing through to what you assume must be the surface. At the bottom of this tree you see a wooden chest... large 1m by 1m by 1m almost and 2 wooden desks standing on the left side between the sarcophagai and the altar...

And that is where I will leave the game tonight... 
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:07 PM
Standing up and walking... you can make it all the way to Peridot who is currently still on the floor 😂

Burger — Yesterday at 11:11 PM
I have dark vision so do I need to do a stealth check when I need to move?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:12 PM
These sarcophagai are giving Arden the creeps, he's almost certain there's going to be some undead that jump out.... Their existence challenge the harmony Zivara seeks, representing a disruption to the natural order and balance.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 8:02 AM
Enyawd glares into the room ahead, blinking his eyes. He is alert, scanning for goblins and other threats - ready to permanently undead any undead. He is really tempted to go searching through these sarcophagi
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 8:23 AM
"Oi nature boy dont you still have dem magic stones? We can flick one in to see if it triggers the sarcophagai/ potential traps? Perhaps even draw out a potential ambush? What say you?" 
Burger — Today at 11:36 AM
"Psst, hay Nero do you think we should pursue after Arden and Peridot, maybe there are enemy's or an ambush"
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:43 AM
Jip... so dark vision helps you to see in the dark, but it's not like night vision, it just makes seeing slightly easier. So in total darkness you can see slightly better and in low light you can see as normal.

Your stealth check would determine how well you can move in the area without making a sound or leaving a trace of your movement.
Burger — Today at 11:44 AM
so what do I need to do to go where peridot is
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:45 AM
I already did my stealth check and made it to Arden and peridot right dm? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:46 AM
You can make a Stealth Check to see how stealthily you can make your way over there.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:47 AM
Jip... Making your way over there you got the feeling that you might have made some noise,  but nothing jumped out or attacked you while you moved in that direction.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:48 AM
His spell is only active for 1min ( I believe)... so he would have to cast it again if you wanted to use it.

Magic Stone
transmutation cantrip. (Artificer, Druid, Warlock)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description
You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.
Spell | EE 160
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:38 PM

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:42 PM
Arden channels the essence of Zivara, reflecting on the profound interconnectedness that binds them to the room's ancient relics. He whispers a silent vow of stewardship for the earth and its mysteries, a promise rooted in the core teachings of Zivara. With a mindful gesture, Arden reaches out to touch the cold stone beneath him, his touch a silent prayer for guidance and protection. In this moment of quiet anticipation, he embodies the living bridge between the ancient past and the present, a guardian of balance and harmony, awaiting the signs that would reveal their path forward.

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

you could in theory cast it on my staff
Ky — Today at 5:40 PM
I can do that if you would like

I'm keeping up with the reading, but been soo busy today that I don't get a chance to post and my phone is on 5% now and I have loadshedding... so I will be back a little later tonight. 

In the meantime... let me know if you are gonna light a torch or cast light or stay innthe dark and try tonbe stealthy...and then from there we can determine what is what.
Jarrod — Today at 5:50 PM
I think ill scout first if i see nothing then you throw a pebble of light in

Depending on your light situation... I will tell you what you see...
Jarrod — Today at 5:56 PM
we know how the room looks but any goblins or creatures?
currently no light but maybe a torch from the doorway? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:58 PM
You can do a perception check...all of you actually but that will depend on the light... what type of light and where the light is to inform me on whether you can do as normal or at disadvantage or just in general what the DC for the check can be 🤔
Jarrod — Today at 5:59 PM
well peridot believes that there isnt any danger really and will ask tova for light on a pebble that he will throw in the room to light it up a bit
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 6:01 PM
Arden moves his hand and subtly brushes it against the moss-covered floor, a quiet commune with nature while he waits for the party to decide their next action. 
Are there any torches on the walls?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:02 PM
Cool... so the light will be a 20ft radius of bright light and 20ft radius of low light and the remaining 20ft (where the light is not) will be in darkness... so where is the pebble headed? 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:03 PM
There are sconces... so holds for the torches, but there aren't any torches...

Who has a background as a soldier or knight or some military command?
Jarrod — Today at 6:05 PM
As close to the center as possible
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:07 PM
So lets say near the altar... give me a perception check to determine what you see... or an investigation check if you want to make sense of what you see or a history check for anyone with a background as soldier or knight or any military ...

Jarrod — Today at 7:37 PM
For narrative sake we say peridot asked before going in
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:01 PM
Everyone except Nero, who is still in his shell, and Tova who is still hiding in the walkway can now see much more clearly in the room now that there is light.

The wall of this part of the "cave" is smooth carved stone. Depicted on the walls is a battle scene... knights fighting goblins, judging by the cracks in the walls and the discolorationof the paint, Enyawd could tell that this place has been here for a very long time. Clearly made by humans but then taken over by goblins it is hard to tell exactly because of the mess the goblins made.

The sarcophagai each would have had a knight's name carved in the top of them... but it has been scratched off crudely with a blunt knife.

The large altar in the middle, clearly had some importance with 6 concave carvings, 3 on each side and in the middle an inlay in the shape of a dagger.

The 2 desks, wooden...much newer than the rest of the tomb it would seem have some papers on them that has also been partly destroyed.

The chest, set into the roots of this massive tree is made from sturdy wood and reinforced with iron bands. Looking at it from the front you see a "fist sized" hole where you would usually find the locking mechanism...

Patty, please give me a History Check...

Arden, please give me a Nature Check...

Ky — Today at 9:11 PM
Tova will feel the stone using her Dwarven stoney senses 🤭 but she will pay special attention to the concave carvings. Can she tell what they are now that she is closer? Does she recognize the carvings from her years spent studying? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:12 PM

I would say, mostly the Dwarven history but world history to a certain degree. Also healing, some magic and clericy things... How to serve your god and not piss them off so they help you and bestow certain gifts every now and then. Tova clearly needs to work on that one though
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:24 PM
Peridot... Looking at the sarcophagai you notice that all of them seem to have scratch marks where the lid and the base meet. Looking at most of the sarcophagai you can't make out the names of the others but one name might be Jeffery or something of the sort.

Patty... with your military experience and background you will be able to tell that this place was originally used as a hideout and fortified as such, with various types of traps and then converted into a tomb.
Tova... give me an Arcana or Religion check...
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:26 PM

Enyawd... looking specifically at the carvings on the walls and the depiction of the battle between the knights and the battles you see a scene unfold of 7 knights fighting against what appears to be 100 goblins... Each of these knights clad in finest armor and wielding weapons adorned with fine gemstones.

Using your hand to gently wipe away some dust, you read the words in common... Sacrifice, duty, honor.

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 9:43 PM
Arden, drawn by the enigmatic presence of the tree at the end of the hallway, moves towards it with a reverence reserved for the sanctity of nature. Once he reaches it, he extends a hand, gently pressing his palm against its bark, closing his eyes to better attune his spirit to the life force before him. In this moment of communion, he seeks to understand the tree's significance, its roots buried deep in the lore of this place, hoping to unravel the mysteries it guards.

Enyawd will help. No dwarf deserves to be left in a puddle of water, below ground or not.
Enyawd, being part of the mountain dwarf rescue team in his youth, rigs a quick retrieval system for the newbie with the ropes in his bag.
Alternatively someone could just levitate his body up, out the pit and onto the altar

Avrae

 — Today at 9:54 PM

Turtlebaff420
Levitate
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

I was chatting to Ky earlier this week about the Play by Post and she had a great idea... The Play by Post is basically a one shot, it is a simple idea and you can build the game literally as you play... So after this game is done, if anyone here would like to try DM'ing, running the Play by Post might be a great idea. It takes the pressure off a bit coz you have more time to respond and think about things...

I am happy to run the Play by Post as I am really enjoying it, but if you would like your hand at trying to DM... the option is available 😁

Lol next time when the wise old players say don't touch it means don't touch.... there's a reason why some parties take an hour to open a door/chest ect as now you know suspect....EVERYTHING ....it could be a trap or just a mimic wanting to kill you and your party.....so yeah especially when new follow the lead until you've learnt the basics of dose and donts

Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:31 PM
Au'lun... With a 4... I would say that you can definitely tell that there are deeper areas and shallower areas in the pit that is filled with water. Looking at one of the more shallow areas (on the side that you came from) there are iron bars just below the water surface and a room that seems to sit just above the water on the other side. Just to the left of the bars is an iron gate.

You struggle to make a connection as to what is what, but you can tell looking at the sarcophagai that there are scratch marks on the outside between the lid and the base...
Ky — Today at 12:34 PM
Can Tova tell of the scratches are made with a weapon or something else? Does it look like the names that were scratched off or something else? Is it 9on all the sarcophagai?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:02 PM
Looking at them the scratches could be from a weapon or something else, you aren't able to tell. The names of all of them are scratched off, as to "deface" them as the scratches are just over the names and then on the side where the base and lid meet as if someone tried to open them.

@Setto Kaiba has my enlarge worn off yet?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:29 PM
This is what you know...

The chest, set into the roots of this massive tree is made from sturdy wood and reinforced with iron bands. Looking at it from the front you see a "fist sized" hole where you would usually find the locking mechanism.

You can give me an Arcana check if you want to determine if there is magic in this area.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:30 PM
All of us in the room?
Jarrod — Today at 2:30 PM
Can peridot try to open the chest?
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:30 PM
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:30 PM
This is what you know already...

The wall of this part of the "cave" is smooth carved stone. Depicted on the walls is a battle scene... knights fighting goblins, judging by the cracks in the walls and the discolorationof the paint, Enyawd could tell that this place has been here for a very long time. Clearly made by humans but then taken over by goblins it is hard to tell exactly because of the mess the goblins made.

The sarcophagai each would have had a knight's name carved in the top of them... but it has been scratched off crudely with a blunt knife.

The large altar in the middle, clearly had some importance with 6 concave carvings, 3 on each side and in the middle an inlay in the shape of a dagger.

The 2 desks, wooden...much newer than the rest of the tomb it would seem have some papers on them that has also been partly destroyed.

The chest, set into the roots of this massive tree is made from sturdy wood and reinforced with iron bands. Looking at it from the front you see a "fist sized" hole where you would usually find the locking mechanism...

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:48 PM
That's not how a check works... That is considered meta gaming since your character does not know that you rolled bad. Since your characer would have looked as thoroughly as he could he would not know that he might have missed something.

You are welcome to call a party member over with more experience in a certain skill and let them try 🤔
Jarrod — Today at 2:49 PM
Not peridot he has a +0
For him he’s like yeah thats a desk with paper alright

Fair enough apologies the intention wasn't to meta. It was more like....dammit this doesn't help maby there's something I missed kinda search. Kinda how like when you loose something and check the same spot multiple times?

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:59 PM
Aren't you looking at the chest?
Arden... give me an investigation check... Since Nero is helping it would be at advantage, but since the papers are written in goblin and you can't read goblin it will just be a standard check.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:01 PM
Am I just there for advantage?
Jarrod — Today at 3:03 PM
Yea and having heard arden mention the magic protection somewhere i will leave the chest
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:05 PM
When assisting someone in a check in 5e you are able to give that person advantage... If he was assisting you, you would have gotten the advantage. By showing him the documents and basically translating this for him he is able to now do a straight check instead of disadvantage which I would have given him due to him not being able to read goblin.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:06 PM
Oh ok cool

With yourself and Arden and Nero looking at the papers you point out something... Nero, being the only between you that can read the map, and Arden having the map from Gregory Nero is able to point out that there is mention of a base deep in the mountains. Arden would recognize this as the 2nd location marked on the map from Gregory...

From the papers on the table, the 3 of you are able to gather that this is  an outpost for the goblins, resupply and stock up... once belonging to a group of knights that fought a battle against "a hundred" goblins... perhapd even the same teibe of goblins you now face.

Popping your head under the water on this side for a moment and then popping up on the other side you see a small room... a cell. Presumably this pit was not supposed to be flooded with water, but with age it has started to form cracks in the rocks allowing water to seep through. 

As you pop your head up in the cell, you see tied, with make shirft ropes, a Dragonborn in full armor... @Burger what does Pizza look like

Picture this: a fierce and mighty creature, with emerald green scales shimmering in the sunlight. Their eyes, like two orbs of glowing jade, hold a hint of mischief and intelligence. With each breath, they exhale a gentle breeze, carrying the scent of nature's secrets. This dragonborn is not only a formidable warrior, but also a master of nature's magic, commanding the forces of growth and rejuvenation. They possess an unwavering loyalty to their allies and a deep connection to the natural world. So, watch out, because when this green dragonborn takes flight, they bring a whole new level of coolness to the battlefield! 🐉✨

Thinking quite a while about it, Nero please try to move one sarcophagus with your mage hand. I got a suspicion
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:03 PM
Didn't share...
But only because the 3rd dwarf died a few seconds later

Do you think the alter is the 7th sarcophagus?
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:07 PM
I do
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:07 PM
Not quite Nero remarks...I believe the 7th....is either a sacrifice...or the sacrificer ....
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:08 PM
I think we need something from each sarcophagus and then the dagger from inside the chest
To open up the altar, which is the 7th tomb

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:57 PM
Arden, intrigued by Ae'lun's introduction, offers a warm, if slightly bemused, smile. "A friend of nature's creatures is a friend of mine," he remarks, extending a hand in greeting to this new potential friend. With a gentle nod, he adds, "The bond between beings and the natural world is sacred. Your affinity for donkeys speaks of a kindred spirit." Arden's eyes, alight with curiosity, suggest an eagerness to learn more about this new friend's background and his interest in donkeys.

Detect Magic
1st-level divination. (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, Arcana Domain, Oath of the Watchers)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action (ritual)
Range: Self (30 ft. sphere)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
Spell | BR 231

You got it! If you’re a spellcaster, now you can even cast !cast those spells, too. It also works with all of the other lookup commands as well, like !monster, !item, or /lookup feat.

Plus, you can share the fun with the rest of your party using D&D Beyond's Campaign Content Sharing. That lets the whole group share their unlocked game content with each other, and it works here in Avrae, too!

Campaign Link
If Pizza is assigned to a D&D Beyond campaign, it gets even better! The DM for that campaign can link it to a specific Discord channel by using !campaign [campaign_link] in that channel. This will tie that channel to your campaign’s Game Log.

After that, any rolls you make here in Avrae will show up in real time in the Game Log. Plus, any digital dice rolls on your character sheet in D&D Beyond will also be sent to the Game Log, and back to your Discord channel as well!

Once your campaign is linked, let’s make a stealth check and see it in action.

Arden looks at this potential friend and notes that he's interested to learn more about his background and his interest in donkeys.

"Let me introduce myself, my name is pizza. I'm a soldier who fought in many grate wars after all the fighting and violence I brought back the grate connection I have with nature it self. While understanding and comprehending the true power and love that this world gives I fell in love with a druid in her animal form I've only seen her in her animal form but I can feel there is something more than just a donkey and so I set out my own quest to find her, to find love.

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 10:29 AM
Observing the futility of the on-going bickering, especially in light of the potential dangers that lurk within the tomb, Arden decides to intervene. With a firm but calm authority, Arden steps forward. "Enough, children," he begins, his voice carrying the weight of wisdom and experience. "Our energy and focus must be conserved for the challenges that lie ahead, not wasted on petty disputes. Let us remember the strength found in unity and the shared purpose that guides us." His words serve not only as a rebuke but also as a reminder of their collective mission, urging the party to rise above personal grievances for the greater good of their quest.
Burger — Today at 10:32 AM
Agreed, thank you Arden for your wisdom full words. Sorry Nero I did not mean what I sayd.

Ae'lun would like to prick his finger on the point of his dagger and see if the alter reacts at all to a drop of blood
Ky — Today at 12:02 PM
Tova, looking at the words on the wall 'sacrifice, duty, honour' and then back at Ae'lun thinks he has the right idea. She will walk back to the alter and do the same over one of the concave cravings. 
Burger — Today at 12:05 PM
"If it's sacrifice, did one of your allies die? , does that not count as a sacrifice" 
Ky — Today at 12:09 PM
Nothing happened when he died, so I am not sure. I don't think it counts if he died because he touched something he shouldn't. I think a sacrifice needs to be purposeful 🤔
Burger — Today at 12:28 PM
Oh ok doki
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:56 PM
It is currently around 4pm in game time...

Burger — Today at 12:58 PM
Whooo I don't think we need to get killed 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:58 PM
Au'lun, you take your dagger and prick your finger, with the blood dripping into one of the concave inserts... Doing this you feel a warm feeling wash over you, and then as your blood stops dripping you loose the feeling again...
Looking at the insert you would know that one person would possibly be able to fill one of the inserts with blood, should they cut their hand and let the blood run, without loosing to much blood.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 1:05 PM
so we're all going to give our hands a slice, and drop blood into the concave things?
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:07 PM
Nero will give willingly
Ky — Today at 1:09 PM
6 of us anyways
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:11 PM
Nero pulls his dagger out and instructs each of the others to take their places by the sarcophagai....."be this how I end I lay my life down for my compatriots without hesitation. " he slices his palm and holds it ready blood slowly trickling through his clenched fists....
"Ready your weapons my friends and whatever happens....we fight as one and die as one."
Jarrod — Today at 1:12 PM
Peridot will do so as well
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:12 PM
One is the "sacrifice " the others must take their places at each sarcophagai
Ky — Today at 1:13 PM
I disagree. There are 6 concaves. I think we need blood in each 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:14 PM
6 sarcophagai 7 soldiers. Unity, honor..the sacrifice " just flip it
Jarrod — Today at 1:14 PM
One concave each i agree with tova
Ky — Today at 1:14 PM
Yes, sacrifice from 6 soldiers for the 7th
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:14 PM
☝️
Ky — Today at 1:15 PM
One person can fill one concave
There are 6
That need to be filled
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:15 PM
Alright but the math doesn't add up....what happened to the 7th then
Jarrod — Today at 1:16 PM
That we don’t know. We couldnt decern
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 1:17 PM
Enyawd will spare some blood
Burger — Today at 1:17 PM
Lol I first read willy 😂
I'll hold the blade of my dagger in my hand and when I need to ill pull the blade and let the blood drip on the alter or sarcophagus
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:39 PM
Arden steps forward with a quiet resolve. Instead of using a blade, he carefully pricks his palm with a thorn plucked from the nearby tree. As his blood begins to drip into the concave, mingling with that of his companions, he reflects on the cycle of life and the sacrifices sometimes required to unearth deeper truths.
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 1:45 PM
Ae'lun puts his finger in his mouth to stop the bleeding and then says "well that definitely gave me the tingles" then takes his dagger in his left hand and slices the palm of his right, wincing from the pain he fills one of the concave sections.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:06 PM
Who is not giving their blood...
Ky — Today at 2:13 PM
I think it's Ae'lun, Arden, Enyawd, Nero, Peridot and Tova currently doing it
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:21 PM
Pizza too apparently so that's six for six
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 2:21 PM
Enyawd calls Pizza over... "Lizard man, you better contribute willingly, or we'll assist you to contribute unwillingly"
Jarrod — Today at 2:21 PM
Pizza doesnt need to as there’s already 6
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 2:22 PM

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:22 PM

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:23 PM

Burger — Today at 2:35 PM
I'm no stranger to sacrifice, and I am willing to do so 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:50 PM
Arden observes the group's anticipation for a response from the ancient alter. He says, "Let's be patient and respectful, we have engaged with the ancient energies of this place. Our offering is not just of blood, but of trust in the wisdom of those who came before us."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:03 PM
"Perhaps we should utter the phrase to activate the alter....as those who lay here enacted long since past🤔"
@Deformiter (Arden) @Burger @Enyawd Nightbeard @Basically_A_Chicken @Ky
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 4:25 PM
Enyawd will say the phrase, "Sacrifice, duty, honor."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:26 PM
Nero follows suit," Sacrifice,  duty, honor. "
Jarrod — Today at 4:29 PM
"you guys are stupid" and peridot cuts his hand fills up the cup and walks off to about 15ft away
"Oh nero thanks for the dagger here you go"
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:33 PM
"Ahhh, that hurt way more than I though it was going to"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:52 PM
"Perhaps if you have a better plan you're welcome to share your theory with the rest of us Mr smarty pants.....whats the big idea huh?" The ritual of requires us to work together 
Ky — Today at 4:53 PM
Tova will cut her palm and fill the concave insert muttering the words
Jarrod — Today at 4:54 PM
"No need to be on edge like that, my concave is full. Don't see any reason for saying the words"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:56 PM
"No need for name calling either" Nero mutters we all want to same thing don't we?
Perhaps the tombs spell is affecting us the longer we engagae🤔

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:15 PM
Technically yes if it's given willingly 🤔

Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:36 PM
As each of you (except for Pizza) fills the concave "bowl" with your blood you suddenly hear the sound of a stone door sliding... Looking over to the right of the chest you see a door reveal itself, set into the wall.

Beyond this doorway is another passage about 40ft long, dark as the rest of the tomb and just wide enough for a single person to pass at a time...
Jarrod — Today at 7:37 PM
Peridot will go in and sneak through to see what he could possibly find
