Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Cool... What is the party's plan?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Im also wondering
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Peridot will walk to the stairs stealthy to try and get a view of what could lay below.
this wouldve happened before the smashing of boxes but if we past that then its okay
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:20 PM
Going with a torch?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:21 PM
noooo bad idea
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:24 PM
Heading down the stairs into the room below... you wouldn't be able to see much more of the room than you previously did as it is quite dark, especially since the pit is 100ft deep (that you know of)
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:26 PM
or ill take a caltrop and ask tova to cast light on it and throw it down the stairs but have it covered in my robes till i get to the stairs
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:32 PM
Arden follows closely behind Peridot, melding into the shadows with practiced ease. Leveraging his darkvision and his connection to nature, he scans for roots that might betray the presence of nearby threats. His hands lightly brush against the stone walls and grab hold of the nearest root he can find, sensing for the subtlest disturbances that could indicate danger.
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:33 PM
or that I too have darkvision
Ky — Yesterday at 9:35 PM
Are you guys moving back towards the room with the pit and the goblins we left behind?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
Yea to the stairs we got attacked after the spears
Burger — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
I have dark vision, I see up to 60 feet in the dark but in grays and blacks
What does the room look like?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 9:41 PM
I'll put out my lantern, with Shnuggles flying behind me. I'll try my best to follow the group in the dark once again
Ky — Yesterday at 9:43 PM
Tova will suggest that she goes first, as the one in heavy armor, so that she can cast fog cloud (2nd lvl) on the wall with the holes so that hopefully the goblins can't see us move past and even if they hear us, attacks should be at disadvantage. We won't be able to explore but maybe move passed and see what is next... Though that does have it's own risks. We could run into an ambush considering they know we are there and have had time to figure out their own plan of action
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
Arden heard Tova and nods his head in agreement, moving out of the way to let her past him.
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
"Just a quick scout ahead I can get out real quick, in and out just to get some intel"
Burger — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
Do when know what is in the pit?
We*
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
Arden looks around and waits for the rest of the group to decide what they want to do, he's perfectly comfortable hidden with his Mask of the Wild
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:50 PM
We were just right now between the door and those black boxes. Now we are attempting to go right, toward the "mostly unknown" area, which is the pit, there's a thin ledge on either side of the pit. Where those dashed lines are, there were holes in the walls, where goblins attacked us with poison spears.

This was the map Ae'lun drew with a stick on the floor 😄
Burger — Yesterday at 9:52 PM
Dumb idea but can't we like use the pelt of the big boars  as a disguise and scare the goblins away? 😂
Burger — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
Patty gives Ae'lun a pat on the back 😂
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
'Psst Arden lets go scout' Peridot will say to Arden just wanting to grab intel. PS this is a whisper
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:56 PM
Arden, whispers in agreement, noting that the rest of the party seems to be keen to hang back for a bit, we need some more information, our party will make a lot of noise unintentionally and we could risk falling into another trap
Ky — Yesterday at 9:58 PM
Wait, the fog cloud is a sphere which means we will have to walk through it too. But if I cast it on one side of the pit to obscure the vision of the goblins that would be 'shooting' arrows at us, and then we crawl along the other edge so we are under the hole height, we could get across but we still don't know what is on the other side
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:00 PM
Arden decides to meditate on it and see if Zivara might have some answers.
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:01 PM
Sorry everyone what did I miss....170+ messages😂

Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 10:08 PM
could I send Shnuggles ahead with Arden and Peridot to check things out?
or would you rather he hang back?
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
Nero obviously took what he could from the boars as they make some of the tastiest biltong in all the planes
He would also like to cast blade ward on his shell again @Setto Kaiba
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:18 PM
Is he stealthy? or will he be flap flap flapping? 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:21 PM
Sure... after killing the boars 🐗 you spend the next hour while Nero skins and cuts up the boar and Patty helps to construct a door...

Arden would like to use his druidic abilities (and "Keen Senses"), feeling the earth around them, taking hold of some roots and using the interconnectedness of nature to find nearby enemies.

You make it all the way to end.... turn left and make it to the hallway on the other end of the pit...when you hear this scratching sound and looking back you see this dwarf clumsily trying to crawl closer 😂

Arden and Peridot, reaching the other side you see infront of you a 30ft hallway about 10ft wide and 60ft high...
Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
Looking back "Shh be careful, maybe wait here for a sec. Arden lets go"

Peridot and Arden... looking into the room, you see...

6 sarcophagai 3 to your left and 3 to your right... in the middle of the room is an altar made of marble and at the back is a huge tree recessed into the wall and growing through to what you assume must be the surface. At the bottom of this tree you see a wooden chest... large 1m by 1m by 1m almost and 2 wooden desks standing on the left side between the sarcophagai and the altar...

And that is where I will leave the game tonight... 
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:07 PM
Standing up and walking... you can make it all the way to Peridot who is currently still on the floor 😂

Burger — Yesterday at 11:11 PM
I have dark vision so do I need to do a stealth check when I need to move?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:12 PM
These sarcophagai are giving Arden the creeps, he's almost certain there's going to be some undead that jump out.... Their existence challenge the harmony Zivara seeks, representing a disruption to the natural order and balance.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 8:02 AM
Enyawd glares into the room ahead, blinking his eyes. He is alert, scanning for goblins and other threats - ready to permanently undead any undead. He is really tempted to go searching through these sarcophagi
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 8:23 AM
"Oi nature boy dont you still have dem magic stones? We can flick one in to see if it triggers the sarcophagai/ potential traps? Perhaps even draw out a potential ambush? What say you?" 
Burger — Today at 11:36 AM
"Psst, hay Nero do you think we should pursue after Arden and Peridot, maybe there are enemy's or an ambush"
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:43 AM
Jip... so dark vision helps you to see in the dark, but it's not like night vision, it just makes seeing slightly easier. So in total darkness you can see slightly better and in low light you can see as normal.

Your stealth check would determine how well you can move in the area without making a sound or leaving a trace of your movement.
Burger — Today at 11:44 AM
so what do I need to do to go where peridot is
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:45 AM
I already did my stealth check and made it to Arden and peridot right dm? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:46 AM
You can make a Stealth Check to see how stealthily you can make your way over there.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:47 AM
Jip... Making your way over there you got the feeling that you might have made some noise,  but nothing jumped out or attacked you while you moved in that direction.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:48 AM
His spell is only active for 1min ( I believe)... so he would have to cast it again if you wanted to use it.

Magic Stone
transmutation cantrip. (Artificer, Druid, Warlock)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description
You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.
Spell | EE 160
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:38 PM

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:42 PM
Arden channels the essence of Zivara, reflecting on the profound interconnectedness that binds them to the room's ancient relics. He whispers a silent vow of stewardship for the earth and its mysteries, a promise rooted in the core teachings of Zivara. With a mindful gesture, Arden reaches out to touch the cold stone beneath him, his touch a silent prayer for guidance and protection. In this moment of quiet anticipation, he embodies the living bridge between the ancient past and the present, a guardian of balance and harmony, awaiting the signs that would reveal their path forward.

You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action.

If you target an object held or worn by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.

you could in theory cast it on my staff
Ky — Today at 5:40 PM
I can do that if you would like

I'm keeping up with the reading, but been soo busy today that I don't get a chance to post and my phone is on 5% now and I have loadshedding... so I will be back a little later tonight. 

In the meantime... let me know if you are gonna light a torch or cast light or stay innthe dark and try tonbe stealthy...and then from there we can determine what is what.
Jarrod — Today at 5:50 PM
I think ill scout first if i see nothing then you throw a pebble of light in

Depending on your light situation... I will tell you what you see...
Jarrod — Today at 5:56 PM
we know how the room looks but any goblins or creatures?
currently no light but maybe a torch from the doorway? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:58 PM
You can do a perception check...all of you actually but that will depend on the light... what type of light and where the light is to inform me on whether you can do as normal or at disadvantage or just in general what the DC for the check can be 🤔
Jarrod — Today at 5:59 PM
well peridot believes that there isnt any danger really and will ask tova for light on a pebble that he will throw in the room to light it up a bit
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 6:01 PM
Arden moves his hand and subtly brushes it against the moss-covered floor, a quiet commune with nature while he waits for the party to decide their next action. 
Are there any torches on the walls?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:02 PM
Cool... so the light will be a 20ft radius of bright light and 20ft radius of low light and the remaining 20ft (where the light is not) will be in darkness... so where is the pebble headed? 🤔
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:03 PM
There are sconces... so holds for the torches, but there aren't any torches...

Who has a background as a soldier or knight or some military command?
Jarrod — Today at 6:05 PM
As close to the center as possible
Setto Kaiba — Today at 6:07 PM
So lets say near the altar... give me a perception check to determine what you see... or an investigation check if you want to make sense of what you see or a history check for anyone with a background as soldier or knight or any military ...

Jarrod — Today at 7:37 PM
For narrative sake we say peridot asked before going in
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:01 PM
Everyone except Nero, who is still in his shell, and Tova who is still hiding in the walkway can now see much more clearly in the room now that there is light.

The wall of this part of the "cave" is smooth carved stone. Depicted on the walls is a battle scene... knights fighting goblins, judging by the cracks in the walls and the discolorationof the paint, Enyawd could tell that this place has been here for a very long time. Clearly made by humans but then taken over by goblins it is hard to tell exactly because of the mess the goblins made.

The sarcophagai each would have had a knight's name carved in the top of them... but it has been scratched off crudely with a blunt knife.

The large altar in the middle, clearly had some importance with 6 concave carvings, 3 on each side and in the middle an inlay in the shape of a dagger.

The 2 desks, wooden...much newer than the rest of the tomb it would seem have some papers on them that has also been partly destroyed.

The chest, set into the roots of this massive tree is made from sturdy wood and reinforced with iron bands. Looking at it from the front you see a "fist sized" hole where you would usually find the locking mechanism...

Patty, please give me a History Check...

Arden, please give me a Nature Check...

Ky — Today at 9:11 PM
Tova will feel the stone using her Dwarven stoney senses 🤭 but she will pay special attention to the concave carvings. Can she tell what they are now that she is closer? Does she recognize the carvings from her years spent studying? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:12 PM

I would say, mostly the Dwarven history but world history to a certain degree. Also healing, some magic and clericy things... How to serve your god and not piss them off so they help you and bestow certain gifts every now and then. Tova clearly needs to work on that one though
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:24 PM
Peridot... Looking at the sarcophagai you notice that all of them seem to have scratch marks where the lid and the base meet. Looking at most of the sarcophagai you can't make out the names of the others but one name might be Jeffery or something of the sort.

Patty... with your military experience and background you will be able to tell that this place was originally used as a hideout and fortified as such, with various types of traps and then converted into a tomb.
Tova... give me an Arcana or Religion check...
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:26 PM

Enyawd... looking specifically at the carvings on the walls and the depiction of the battle between the knights and the battles you see a scene unfold of 7 knights fighting against what appears to be 100 goblins... Each of these knights clad in finest armor and wielding weapons adorned with fine gemstones.

Using your hand to gently wipe away some dust, you read the words in common... Sacrifice, duty, honor.

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 9:43 PM
Arden, drawn by the enigmatic presence of the tree at the end of the hallway, moves towards it with a reverence reserved for the sanctity of nature. Once he reaches it, he extends a hand, gently pressing his palm against its bark, closing his eyes to better attune his spirit to the life force before him. In this moment of communion, he seeks to understand the tree's significance, its roots buried deep in the lore of this place, hoping to unravel the mysteries it guards.

Enyawd will help. No dwarf deserves to be left in a puddle of water, below ground or not.
Enyawd, being part of the mountain dwarf rescue team in his youth, rigs a quick retrieval system for the newbie with the ropes in his bag.
Alternatively someone could just levitate his body up, out the pit and onto the altar

Avrae

 — Today at 9:54 PM

Turtlebaff420
Levitate
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

I was chatting to Ky earlier this week about the Play by Post and she had a great idea... The Play by Post is basically a one shot, it is a simple idea and you can build the game literally as you play... So after this game is done, if anyone here would like to try DM'ing, running the Play by Post might be a great idea. It takes the pressure off a bit coz you have more time to respond and think about things...

I am happy to run the Play by Post as I am really enjoying it, but if you would like your hand at trying to DM... the option is available 😁

Lol next time when the wise old players say don't touch it means don't touch.... there's a reason why some parties take an hour to open a door/chest ect as now you know suspect....EVERYTHING ....it could be a trap or just a mimic wanting to kill you and your party.....so yeah especially when new follow the lead until you've learnt the basics of dose and donts

Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:31 PM
Au'lun... With a 4... I would say that you can definitely tell that there are deeper areas and shallower areas in the pit that is filled with water. Looking at one of the more shallow areas (on the side that you came from) there are iron bars just below the water surface and a room that seems to sit just above the water on the other side. Just to the left of the bars is an iron gate.

You struggle to make a connection as to what is what, but you can tell looking at the sarcophagai that there are scratch marks on the outside between the lid and the base...
Ky — Today at 12:34 PM
Can Tova tell of the scratches are made with a weapon or something else? Does it look like the names that were scratched off or something else? Is it 9on all the sarcophagai?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:02 PM
Looking at them the scratches could be from a weapon or something else, you aren't able to tell. The names of all of them are scratched off, as to "deface" them as the scratches are just over the names and then on the side where the base and lid meet as if someone tried to open them.

@Setto Kaiba has my enlarge worn off yet?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:29 PM
This is what you know...

The chest, set into the roots of this massive tree is made from sturdy wood and reinforced with iron bands. Looking at it from the front you see a "fist sized" hole where you would usually find the locking mechanism.

You can give me an Arcana check if you want to determine if there is magic in this area.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:30 PM
All of us in the room?
Jarrod — Today at 2:30 PM
Can peridot try to open the chest?
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:30 PM
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:30 PM
This is what you know already...

The wall of this part of the "cave" is smooth carved stone. Depicted on the walls is a battle scene... knights fighting goblins, judging by the cracks in the walls and the discolorationof the paint, Enyawd could tell that this place has been here for a very long time. Clearly made by humans but then taken over by goblins it is hard to tell exactly because of the mess the goblins made.

The sarcophagai each would have had a knight's name carved in the top of them... but it has been scratched off crudely with a blunt knife.

The large altar in the middle, clearly had some importance with 6 concave carvings, 3 on each side and in the middle an inlay in the shape of a dagger.

The 2 desks, wooden...much newer than the rest of the tomb it would seem have some papers on them that has also been partly destroyed.

The chest, set into the roots of this massive tree is made from sturdy wood and reinforced with iron bands. Looking at it from the front you see a "fist sized" hole where you would usually find the locking mechanism...

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:48 PM
That's not how a check works... That is considered meta gaming since your character does not know that you rolled bad. Since your characer would have looked as thoroughly as he could he would not know that he might have missed something.

You are welcome to call a party member over with more experience in a certain skill and let them try 🤔
Jarrod — Today at 2:49 PM
Not peridot he has a +0
For him he’s like yeah thats a desk with paper alright

Fair enough apologies the intention wasn't to meta. It was more like....dammit this doesn't help maby there's something I missed kinda search. Kinda how like when you loose something and check the same spot multiple times?

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:59 PM
Aren't you looking at the chest?
Arden... give me an investigation check... Since Nero is helping it would be at advantage, but since the papers are written in goblin and you can't read goblin it will just be a standard check.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:01 PM
Am I just there for advantage?
Jarrod — Today at 3:03 PM
Yea and having heard arden mention the magic protection somewhere i will leave the chest
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:05 PM
When assisting someone in a check in 5e you are able to give that person advantage... If he was assisting you, you would have gotten the advantage. By showing him the documents and basically translating this for him he is able to now do a straight check instead of disadvantage which I would have given him due to him not being able to read goblin.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:06 PM
Oh ok cool

With yourself and Arden and Nero looking at the papers you point out something... Nero, being the only between you that can read the map, and Arden having the map from Gregory Nero is able to point out that there is mention of a base deep in the mountains. Arden would recognize this as the 2nd location marked on the map from Gregory...

From the papers on the table, the 3 of you are able to gather that this is  an outpost for the goblins, resupply and stock up... once belonging to a group of knights that fought a battle against "a hundred" goblins... perhapd even the same teibe of goblins you now face.

Popping your head under the water on this side for a moment and then popping up on the other side you see a small room... a cell. Presumably this pit was not supposed to be flooded with water, but with age it has started to form cracks in the rocks allowing water to seep through. 

As you pop your head up in the cell, you see tied, with make shirft ropes, a Dragonborn in full armor... @Burger what does Pizza look like

Picture this: a fierce and mighty creature, with emerald green scales shimmering in the sunlight. Their eyes, like two orbs of glowing jade, hold a hint of mischief and intelligence. With each breath, they exhale a gentle breeze, carrying the scent of nature's secrets. This dragonborn is not only a formidable warrior, but also a master of nature's magic, commanding the forces of growth and rejuvenation. They possess an unwavering loyalty to their allies and a deep connection to the natural world. So, watch out, because when this green dragonborn takes flight, they bring a whole new level of coolness to the battlefield! 🐉✨

I do
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:07 PM

Arden, intrigued by Ae'lun's introduction, offers a warm, if slightly bemused, smile. "A friend of nature's creatures is a friend of mine," he remarks, extending a hand in greeting to this new potential friend. With a gentle nod, he adds, "The bond between beings and the natural world is sacred. Your affinity for donkeys speaks of a kindred spirit." Arden's eyes, alight with curiosity, suggest an eagerness to learn more about this new friend's background and his interest in donkeys.

Detect Magic
1st-level divination. (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, Arcana Domain, Oath of the Watchers)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action (ritual)
Range: Self (30 ft. sphere)
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
Spell | BR 231

You got it! If you’re a spellcaster, now you can even cast !cast those spells, too. It also works with all of the other lookup commands as well, like !monster, !item, or /lookup feat.

Plus, you can share the fun with the rest of your party using D&D Beyond's Campaign Content Sharing. That lets the whole group share their unlocked game content with each other, and it works here in Avrae, too!

Campaign Link
If Pizza is assigned to a D&D Beyond campaign, it gets even better! The DM for that campaign can link it to a specific Discord channel by using !campaign [campaign_link] in that channel. This will tie that channel to your campaign’s Game Log.

After that, any rolls you make here in Avrae will show up in real time in the Game Log. Plus, any digital dice rolls on your character sheet in D&D Beyond will also be sent to the Game Log, and back to your Discord channel as well!

Once your campaign is linked, let’s make a stealth check and see it in action.

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 10:29 AM
Observing the futility of the on-going bickering, especially in light of the potential dangers that lurk within the tomb, Arden decides to intervene. With a firm but calm authority, Arden steps forward. "Enough, children," he begins, his voice carrying the weight of wisdom and experience. "Our energy and focus must be conserved for the challenges that lie ahead, not wasted on petty disputes. Let us remember the strength found in unity and the shared purpose that guides us." His words serve not only as a rebuke but also as a reminder of their collective mission, urging the party to rise above personal grievances for the greater good of their quest.
Burger — Today at 10:32 AM

Tova, looking at the words on the wall 'sacrifice, duty, honour' and then back at Ae'lun thinks he has the right idea. She will walk back to the alter and do the same over one of the concave cravings. 
Burger — Today at 12:05 PM
"If it's sacrifice, did one of your allies die? , does that not count as a sacrifice" 
Ky — Today at 12:09 PM
Nothing happened when he died, so I am not sure. I don't think it counts if he died because he touched something he shouldn't. I think a sacrifice needs to be purposeful 🤔

Whooo I don't think we need to get killed 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:58 PM
Au'lun, you take your dagger and prick your finger, with the blood dripping into one of the concave inserts... Doing this you feel a warm feeling wash over you, and then as your blood stops dripping you loose the feeling again...
Looking at the insert you would know that one person would possibly be able to fill one of the inserts with blood, should they cut their hand and let the blood run, without loosing to much blood.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 1:05 PM
so we're all going to give our hands a slice, and drop blood into the concave things?
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:07 PM
Nero will give willingly
Ky — Today at 1:09 PM
6 of us anyways
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:11 PM
Nero pulls his dagger out and instructs each of the others to take their places by the sarcophagai....."be this how I end I lay my life down for my compatriots without hesitation. " he slices his palm and holds it ready blood slowly trickling through his clenched fists....
"Ready your weapons my friends and whatever happens....we fight as one and die as one."
Jarrod — Today at 1:12 PM
Peridot will do so as well
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:12 PM
One is the "sacrifice " the others must take their places at each sarcophagai
Ky — Today at 1:13 PM
I disagree. There are 6 concaves. I think we need blood in each 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:14 PM
6 sarcophagai 7 soldiers. Unity, honor..the sacrifice " just flip it
Jarrod — Today at 1:14 PM
One concave each i agree with tova
Ky — Today at 1:14 PM
Yes, sacrifice from 6 soldiers for the 7th
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:14 PM
☝️
Ky — Today at 1:15 PM
One person can fill one concave
There are 6
That need to be filled
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 1:15 PM

Jarrod — Today at 1:16 PM
That we don’t know. We couldnt decern
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 1:17 PM
Enyawd will spare some blood
Burger — Today at 1:17 PM
Lol I first read willy 😂
I'll hold the blade of my dagger in my hand and when I need to ill pull the blade and let the blood drip on the alter or sarcophagus
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 1:39 PM
Arden steps forward with a quiet resolve. Instead of using a blade, he carefully pricks his palm with a thorn plucked from the nearby tree. As his blood begins to drip into the concave, mingling with that of his companions, he reflects on the cycle of life and the sacrifices sometimes required to unearth deeper truths.
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 1:45 PM
Ae'lun puts his finger in his mouth to stop the bleeding and then says "well that definitely gave me the tingles" then takes his dagger in his left hand and slices the palm of his right, wincing from the pain he fills one of the concave sections.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:06 PM
Who is not giving their blood...
Ky — Today at 2:13 PM
I think it's Ae'lun, Arden, Enyawd, Nero, Peridot and Tova currently doing it
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:21 PM

Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 2:21 PM

Burger — Today at 2:35 PM
I'm no stranger to sacrifice, and I am willing to do so 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:50 PM
Arden observes the group's anticipation for a response from the ancient alter. He says, "Let's be patient and respectful, we have engaged with the ancient energies of this place. Our offering is not just of blood, but of trust in the wisdom of those who came before us."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:03 PM

@Deformiter (Arden) @Burger @Enyawd Nightbeard @Basically_A_Chicken @Ky

Ky — Today at 4:53 PM
Tova will cut her palm and fill the concave insert muttering the words
Jarrod — Today at 4:54 PM
"No need to be on edge like that, my concave is full. Don't see any reason for saying the words"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:56 PM
"No need for name calling either" Nero mutters we all want to same thing don't we?

As each of you (except for Pizza) fills the concave "bowl" with your blood you suddenly hear the sound of a stone door sliding... Looking over to the right of the chest you see a door reveal itself, set into the wall.

Beyond this doorway is another passage about 40ft long, dark as the rest of the tomb and just wide enough for a single person to pass at a time...

Which one? 4 or 5... Your attack hits anyway as 23 is enough... but just keep in mind only 1 and 2 have moved, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are still in the sarcophagus and with that cover will have +2 to AC... as they are just sitting up
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:20 AM
5
Oh 5 looks like it's out..
Then in that case he takes full movement to line up with 1 and he takes 16 acid damage
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:24 AM
It will hit 5 even though he is kinda covered so if you want to stick to 5 he will take full damage.
Best damage thus far... you moving?

He kinda is in the middle of the 2 though.. He said "kinda in the middle" so he doesn't really need to move from where he is
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:39 AM
Middle of 1 and 5... 1 is the one at Au'lun so them he would have had to move triggering the opportunity attack.
Toombz — Today at 12:41 AM
Oh he said 1 and 5.. sorry I thought 4 and 5 😶
If I may make a suggestion and I know I'm new here and don't understand how the mechanics of online dnd works but I'm just brainstorming here
For time efficiency, maybe we should each follow the blueprint that if it is our turn, we should state everything at once:
(1) Bonus Action
(2) Standard Action
(3) Movement all in one message. Also, we could state a reaction if a certain action is triggered (like a reaction spell)

By listing all of this at once, I'm hoping that it will allow the DM to respond to everything at once and ask possible questions and maybe it will help with the progression of play. How does that sound?
Ky — Today at 12:46 AM
I am not sure if this will work as sometimes when you have an action in mind with a bonus action to follow but your roll doesn't work, your decisions change
Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:48 AM
I like the idea... perhaps you can make it one message and be like, as an action I would like to do this and if it hits I would do this as a bonus 🤔
Maybe added to that even automatically roll damage... if it hit I will immediately be able to assign damage.
Toombz — Today at 12:49 AM
True, but as a general course of action. The DM could query before the player gives the final go-ahead maybe? Just brainstorming as I say
Toombz — Today at 12:49 AM
Exactly.. great idea.. So far, I like the brainstorming
Even a 25% efficiency in time taken per turn might have a huge impact on game flow. Most of the time, a player knows what they want to do and if we can streamline the most of the time actions, then the some of the time actions will be what takes up time and hopefully it will be less time. MAYBE
Don't know if that made any sense🤣🤣
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:00 AM
This might be easier for the more advanced players, but might still get stuck with the newer people as it takes some explaining what can be done and what can't...

I think, for those who know what they want to do and would do it no matter hit or miss (probably ifnit is not dependent on hit or miss) they can declare their actions all at once...for the others perhaps it might not work as well... once you declared an action and it is rolled... then it is considered done.
Toombz — Today at 1:03 AM
I like this.. In that case, maybe you can have a list of players who say what they wanna do in advance and are okay with any unintended consequences. Like for example, if I give my list of things, which includes a movement that leads to an attack of opportunity without me anticipating it, then I take the hit and damage no questions asked so long as I move to the spot I wanted even if I didn't see the attack of opportunity coming? Again, just brainstorming here. If even just a few players do this, time efficiency will go up
If I write I wanna make 2 actions but they are both bonus actions, then obviously the course of action is voided and I must submit a new course of actions. But if I submit a valid course of actions, even if they have some negative consequences I didn't anticipate, I accept them. Hope I'm making sense😬
Toombz — Today at 1:07 AM
But having this blueprint I think would help against making 2 standard actions or 2 bonus actions in one post
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:15 AM
Makes sense... I will think aboutnit some more... Other problem that we might run into is just positioning and posting time. Every person has a 12 hour window to post as we all work and have lives... sometimes people forget where they were positioned or wrongly assume where they were since it is mostly theatre of the mind (luckily Enyawd  has been kind enough to keep us updated via the maps)...

Perhaps something to this effect...I run up to the monster (making sure you have enough movement yourself), I attack with my shortsword and if it hits I will cast shield of faith, if not I will just ready myself forbthe next round... Roll attack and damage...and then we resolve 🤔
Toombz — Today at 1:32 AM
Perfect.. I will let you put in more thought as you said. Wanted just a quick brainstorm session. But I'm happy it was fruitful. Goodnight everyone

We have a system that works and has worked so to avoid confusion best left as is. We know not having played for days could be very frustrating but this game is modeled like a book that yoh write wherever there's times. As dm mentioned we all have lives outside the game some much busier than others and even though it can be a long wait between turns sometimes everyone is on and we play like 2-3hours on the go so it's a luck of the draw kinda game....just roll with it😁🎲

Spiritual Weapon
2nd-level evocation. (Cleric, Life Domain, Oath of Conquest, War Domain)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.
At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above 2nd.

You need to roll the To Hit one first to see if it will hit the AC of the monster. If that number is bigger than the AC of the monster then you hit and then you can apply the damage.

So maintaining concentration on your spell you attack the skeleton, but your weapon is not able to pierce its armor.

You do still have the thunderous smite active... as long as you can maintain concentration on the spell 😁

If that is it...? then Arden can go followed by Au'lun.

Reeling from the impact that forced him out of his Wild Shape form, Arden's survival instincts kick in. He quickly extends his hand towards the nearest skeleton goblin [SG2], fingers splayed, and calls upon the winds to heed his command. With a sharp incantation, a sudden gust [Gust Cantrip] appears in an attempt to propel the creature back, hopefully giving Arden precious space.

transmutation cantrip. (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Instantaneous
Description
You seize the air and compel it to create one of the following effects at a point you can see within range:

One Medium or smaller creature that you choose must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 5 feet away from you.
You create a small blast of air capable of moving one object that is neither held nor carried and that weighs no more than 5 pounds. The object is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. It isn't pushed with enough force to cause damage.
You create a harmless sensory effect using air, such as causing leaves to rustle, wind to slam shutters shut, or your clothing to ripple in a breeze.

Arden shifts his focus, whispering an invocation [Heat Metal Level 2] that causes the armor the skeletal goblin [SG2] is wearing to glow red-hot. The metal begins to sear the skeletal structure, the heat intensifying with Arden's focused will.

Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description
Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.
At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 4:18 PM
Spiritual Weapons do not give flanking to other creatures. However, a creature attacking with their Spiritual Weapon will get flanking if one of their allies is in a position to flank. Flanking states that an ally must be on the other side but not that the attack must come from your position.

Crown of Madness
2nd-level enchantment. (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard, Oathbreaker)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description
One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration.

While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.

The charmed target must use its action before moving on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature or if none are within its reach.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.

Pushing himself up, he steadies his gaze on Tova, "Thank you, for tethering me back to the here and now... the battle calls."

with an 18 AC probably heavy chain and up maybe? (not sure if that's a thing, first time playing any "real" D&D) 
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 12:25 PM
Yes it was confirmed they are wearing plate amour however unless you are a similar height build as a goblin. Unfortunately in this instance (i stand to be corrected) size does matter and if you're 6ft tall trying on amour that's meant for ages 10yrs and younger 😅.... then you may have a cool shoulder pad instead of a chest plate😅. If we had a large mount we could strap what we can carry to it and melt it down into sizeable amour that's the only other way to get it😅
Toombz — Yesterday at 12:35 PM
Yeah the 18 AC made me suspect Plate Armor too🤤
Toombz — Yesterday at 12:36 PM
D&d has some weird mechanics though so fingers crossed, if you're medium size, you can fit medium clothes🤓
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 12:39 PM
Yeah as iv said if your small then you should be fine minding that your classes has access to heavy/plate amour. Bare in mind most goblins aren't medium creatures and are only 3-4ft tall unless stated otherwise
Not to mention as great as heavy amour is for AC. In my opinion it's more of a liability to you and your team most of the time. You'll have disadvantage against stealth checks...if you cross a spell casters with heat metal you're cooked....literally... not to mention if you ever want/need to take it off it takes up to 10 rounds of combat to fully undress and more tomes often than not that's valuable time you could need
Toombz — Yesterday at 1:09 PM
In my experience, I've never needed to take off armour before and I've never seen anyone try and take it off mid fight🤣🤣 and the chances of running into someone who has a heat metal spell is MUCH LOWER than the chances of running into people who can add +4 or more to a d20 attack roll with advantage. So on a balance of probability, having an AC of 20 or more (Shield included) is always more advantageous in my experience. As for stealth checks, also in my experience, you can cast the spell s
Spell  called Silent or allow players with no heavy armour to do the spying while you walk from a distance behind. From my experience with my previous DM, we were the ones always getting surprised while we're sleeping or while we're exploring. Stealth checks aren't really a concern for me. Battle is
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 1:20 PM
there's also a fair chance that its rusted and gross from being worn by corpses for 80 years. we shall have to wait and see
if we survive that is
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 1:31 PM
Each to their own iv had several instances where heavy amour has needed to be taken off. For example a couple of campaigns ago we had a barbarian who after we had a battle went with the group to a hotspring to replenish but while there we got ambushed and a few players nearly died because she had to take so long to put it back. In another campaign we were caught because our plate amour made a hell of a noise while we were trying to make it through a Dungeon very similar to the pit room because the player failed a dex check and tripped. Also can't swim with it on like a PC I once played with tried to only take the bottom off so we could wade across a river we couldn't just jump. He eneded up drowning because he was top heavy and due to the current he got flipped upside down and we couldn't save him in time....


I'm just saying you do you man but in my 6 years of playing its been more of a nuisance than a help...
I speak from experience. Chainmail is much more dependable.... if you must have above 20AC
Toombz — Yesterday at 1:38 PM
I've also played since 2015 and like I said, there is always a trade off.. I used to play a pure sorcerer with a 14 AC and couldn't use armour so that's what I went with into battle. Huge nuisance. My cleric partner who always wore his plate armour and never took it off basically was always more durable in battle than I was because attack rolls are a bigger problem than stealth checks or minor situational inconveniences. During just this campaign for example, I was literally untouched whereas that never happened before when I was a sorcerer (was more often than not either close to unconscious or unconscious). I was always bloody and beaten. On a balance of probability, in my experience, it's always better having high AC than not
Since I've multiclassed as a cleric and sorcerer (I intend to go level 17 sorcerer, level 3 cleric), I am able to enjoy the best of both worlds now.
Toombz — Yesterday at 2:00 PM
Also, Chain Mail gets you AC 16, which is what I have right now. I want Plate because it will get me AC 18, and with my shield, then I'll have 20. With added spells for protection, I'll have 27 AC. Goodluck anyone trying to hit me then. For now my max AC is 25 which isn't bad, but those extra +2 make a difference when facing legendary creatures like Ancient Red Dragons. I'll be able to deal with spellcasters easily once I gain counterspell, rendering things like heat metal obselete
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 2:10 PM
I'd say, at the end of the day, it's completely up to how the DM decides to run the campaign and what gets encountered along the way, both sides of the debate have validity to them, like with anything in D&D, it's up to the player to decide what they feel is best for their character.
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 2:52 PM
Just trying to help him survive then again the last person to heed my warnings did a fantastic job of surviving so by all means like I said you do you I guess😂 
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 2:58 PM
It all depends on your DM... My games are like the Elden Ring version of dnd... if you haven't died yet, you aren't really playing 😂

Also, your Cleric / Sorcerer build has one flaw... you do not have the required strengh to wear your heavy armor thus your movement is only 20ft per turn and not 30ft. Like Arden said, it is give and take.

In terms of taking armor off... during a long rest you can stay in your armor but that will cost you a point of exhaustion, so it is alwaya a good idea for the party to be very careful with where they rest... the world outside town is dangerous, there is a reason normal folk don't go out and deal with this shit themselves.
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:44 PM
True. My DM largely focused on having us deal with non-spellcaster enemies that did a lot of attack rolls so AC was important. Had he focused on spellcasters, perhaps I'd have a different view than I do now but even when we did face spellcasters, there are a lot of attack rolls. I don't mind sacrificing 10ft of movement, it's no skin off my bones. And my DM didn't care where we rested, we were always getting attacked in our sleep, even in like a 5 star establishment 🤣🤣 always found a way to screw us over
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:52 PM
Sleeping in heavy armour, I didn't know about the exhaustion thing which is a bit of a problem. Thanks for the heads up. I'll sleep without armour. But that's where my multiclass feature is pretty awesome. If I don't have heavy armour on during battle, I'm not as weak as I was as a pure sorcerer with 14 AC because I can carry a shield and get +2, I have Shield of Faith which adds +2. Trust me, having 14 AC was a massive problem for me back in the day and my cleric friend not only never went unconscious but dealt seriously devastating damage during battle with Spiritual Weapon and Inflict Wounds. I was planning to do that too but I was saving my Spell slots for in case things became more dire. In the end, I only used 1 level 2 spell slot and used cantrips and remained untouched so even if we immediately get into a new fight after this, I'm on full HP and almost full Spell slots. Basically fresh

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 9:27 PM
Observing Tova's wounds and recognizing her critical role in their survival, Arden, with a steadying breath, channels the healing energies of nature to weave a spell of rejuvenation towards her. "Be mended by the forest's caress," he whispers, casting Healing Word [Level 1] to bolster her resilience.

Then, turning his attention to the immediate threat, Arden recalls the efficacy of his previous spell against the skeletal goblins. With a focused gaze on the skeletal goblin that's menacingly close to both him and Tova [SG2], he invokes the essence of the fire, casting Heat Metal once again. "Let the forge's fury bind your bones," he intones, aiming to make the skeletal goblin's armor unbearably hot, hoping to distract or debilitate it further, giving them a crucial advantage in the relentless dance of death they're ensnared in.

Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

That is a valiant effort from Arden, however do keep in mind that you cannot cast 2 levelled spells in one turn. When you cast a spell as a Bonus Action you can only cast a spell as an Action if it is a Cantrip. Thus the Healing Word will work, but the Heat Metal will not.

True

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 10:28 PM
ah, well then can I make a melee attack instead?

Ky — Today at 10:29 PM
It is a bonus action but you aren't able to cast two level spells per turn. You're only allowed to cast leveled spell  as a bonus action with a cantrip as an action. I think the bonus action spells helps if you make weapon attacks maybe
Setto Kaiba — Today at 10:30 PM
sure
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 10:35 PM
Arden shifts his focus from the arcane to the martial. He grasps his quarterstaff with both hands, the wood humming softly with the residual energy of his druidic magic. "Let nature's wrath be felt," Arden murmurs, more to himself than anyone else, as he raises the quarterstaff. With the precision of a seasoned guardian of the wilds, he aims a sweeping strike towards the skeletal goblin.

Hopefully that atleast manages a hit.... SG1  didn't I mention several times I was targeting that one? My bad. Can't hit the goblin king without it risking being hit and loosing concentration. So SG1 is the only one In range
Ky — Today at 10:43 PM
Yes if the spell you cast says it's a bonus action then you can use a cantrip as an action. Chromatic orb takes an action as does fire bolt. They both take an action to cast meaning you can't cast them both in the same round 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 10:44 PM
Apologies I'm really tired and read I can cast a spell then a cantrip so my mind registered it exactly as is🤦‍♂️.....
Alright disregard the cantrip dm and can I use my bonus action to retreat into my shell? Can't remember if we discussed the mechanic staying the same or not. (Still think its silly to cost an action to go in but a bonus to come out?) 
Jeepers my typos🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

The goblin, (no one left to strike, as there is no one left) seeing that he has no more allies will use his Nimble Escape feature letting him use the Disengage action as a bonus action (as to not provoke any opportunity attacks). He will then use both his movement and action to run back into the room with the pit managing to get just around the corner into that room.
If the party tries to pursue we continue in initiative... if not we can drop out of combat...
Toombz — Today at 2:26 PM
Maybe Dumbledick can be a bit closer to the chest? Even next to it if it won't trigger Teleportation. But otherwise I think that's cool.
Toombz — Today at 2:29 PM

You can tell the dm you don't want to kill just knock it unconscious if you wanted to do that. I think it's a good idea to try at least. We have people that speak goblin I think

Arden lays his hands upon himself, murmuring an ancient incantation that calls forth the healing energies of the earth. As the spell of Cure Wounds [Level 2] takes effect, he feels the warmth of rejuvenation knitting his flesh, sealing cuts, and easing bruises—a tangible manifestation of nature's resilience flowing through him.

Arden then presses forward, covering the ground between him and the goblin. [35ft toward the goblin]

Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:43 PM
if I use my bonus action to command a dash and my action to command an attack?
Jarrod — Today at 4:44 PM
only rogues can bonus action dash
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:48 PM
the primal companion can be commanded to take any action other than attack using one of my bonus actions, but if I want it to attack I must use an action. unless I'm misunderstanding which is very possible
Image
Jarrod — Today at 4:50 PM
if i am reading that correctly you take a bonus action to command it to do an action, it can only take an action
also only 1 action 1 bonus action and movement allowed per round, so 2 actions is not possible
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:51 PM
oh okay, then Ae'lun will just use dash to chase the goblin
this class is useless 😂
Setto Kaiba — Today at 5:11 PM
Yeah... I agree, I don't think snuggles will be able to move and attack... too many actions 🤷‍♂️
Cool... then it is Nero and then Tova
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 6:27 PM
Nero sensing the others  that have given chase would surely catch up to a goblin. He would like to inspect the room apart from the chest for any valuables. Focusing on the bones and sarcophagai

Tova will move as close to the goblin as possible. Depending how close she gets, she will make her move...
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:04 PM
Going over the sarcophagai and the altar, you don't find anything valuable... the chest is the only thing in this room that seems as if it has any value. The Skeletons have plate mail and a scimitar, but these are rusted and would not be able to be used.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:04 PM

Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:05 PM
From your position you will only make it to the entrance of the hallway with a standard move

I would like to stand in the middle of the hallway and take a ready action with my long bow so if I see the goblin I'll shoot

Toombz — Today at 7:14 PM
Dumbledick says "Very well. We shall take our leave but let me try mage hand again but this time, instead of it going into the chest, I wanna see if it can close the chest from the back and if not, lift it from the side.

Levitate
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.
Spell | BR 255
Toombz — Today at 7:20 PM
The fastest way to get to him is through the chest🌚
Dumbledick says jokingly
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:23 PM
@Setto Kaiba humor me
is the pit 100ft from ground level or from the mid air through the portal? I wanted to cast levitate and have Enyawd  kind of zigzag bounce off the walls of the well 20ft per turn ascending in elevation but I see it's only 60ft range😑 
Ky — Today at 7:25 PM
Yep 100ft down. But if we can get him rope, two tied together maybe, the levitate will make climbing easier I think
Ky — Today at 7:25 PM
Tova is done
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:26 PM
It is 100ft from ground level... then you have anout 20ft to the ceiling where you fall from. He could try zig zag jumping... if he made his athletes check 🤣
Enyawd... you are up followed by Peridot.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:28 PM
Oof....and if I were to jump in and cast it just before going splat and because of my shell I can carry Enyawd back up with levitate?🤔
on my turn* sorry 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:34 PM
If you were to touch the chest... fall down into the pit and at the last few ft cast Levitate that would work... Enyawd can hold onto you while you Levitate up...

It will take 20ft per round so that is 5 rounds (if we stay in combat) but yes you can do that.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:35 PM
Ok cool we can do that if we can't find a better way.

I'm confused about the positioning at the moment
Jarrod — Today at 7:52 PM
this one @Deformiter (Arden)
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 7:54 PM
but I moved on my turn, 35ft xD also, the Goblin is way closer than I believed, I thought he was above by the spears around the corner, otherwise I would've done entangle instead of heal 😅
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 7:56 PM
@Deformiter (Arden) ? like this?

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 7:57 PM

I think Tova also moved

no worries 😄 think DM missed it too 😛

Yea, Tova is about the same place as Arden
Toombz — Today at 8:04 PM
For now, let's just use distances rather than the map because maybe it's tricky to coordinate the map right now. I think each player should recall how much distance they covered and compare it to the Goblin's distance covered. The DM will tell us how close you are to the Goblin 
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 8:07 PM
I've got it now
Anyone else moved?

Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 8:13 PM
thank you
Toombz — Today at 8:16 PM
So Enyawd you already rolled an attack roll but since now you know your attack rolls will probably be done at disadvantage, do you wanna rather do something else or try your luck with disadvantage anyways? Who knows, your first roll was 21 if you do 18 or more again, it's a hit!
Jarrod — Today at 8:17 PM
we do not know this as he could not have line of sight and if he does it would at 3/4 cover so +5 to ac so
Toombz — Today at 8:17 PM
True.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:18 PM
The roll will be at disadvantage...for multiple reasons including there is no light... Glad you got a good roll though 👌 
Toombz — Today at 8:20 PM
So must Enyawd must roll again or choose a different action? Or is it up to him still?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:20 PM
He already rolled... thus he should just roll again for the disadvantage.

run up to right behind the goblin with dash then flurry of blows 
straight rolls?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:33 PM
It would be at disadvantage due to ligt... but another question... Doesn't furry of blows require you to take the attack action on your turn 🤔
Jarrod — Today at 8:33 PM
You are correct
damn
okay i can still punch him tho
nope nvm i cannot
Toombz — Today at 8:34 PM
Can't you tackle it to the ground or something or trip it so it can fall? Or will it also be at disadvantage?
Jarrod — Today at 8:35 PM
could i use step of the wind to dash as a bonus action?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:35 PM
Spending that last Ki point?
Jarrod — Today at 8:36 PM
yep
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:36 PM
Where would you like to go?

right behind him
Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:38 PM
If you use your action to dash it covers 60ft ... by my count that would put you behind him 🤔

Setto Kaiba — Today at 8:41 PM
Dumbledick... it's you
Toombz — Today at 9:01 PM
Quick question, I wanna cast dancing lights as a cantrip and the range is 120ft, so if I cast it, would it illuminate the area in which the Goblin is? I ask only because Dumbledick knows that route and so would be able to cast Dancing Lights with precision. And it doesn't say I can only cast dancing lights at a point I CAN SEE, it only says 120ft
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:09 PM
You can cast it, I don't see any limitations... keeping in mind it only provides dim light in 10ft... dim light is still at disadvantage for anyone without dark vision
Deformiter (Arden) — 02/13/2024 9:10 PM
Arden watches the goblin stagger under Peridot's assault, a flicker of satisfaction lighting his wary eyes. "Perhaps the thorny grasp of the earth may remain still," he muses, contemplating the weakening foe before him. The wild within whispers caution, reminding him of the hidden goblins and their poisoned spears lurking within the walls.
Toombz — 02/13/2024 9:11 PM
Oh okay gotcha. In that case I would like to cast Mage Hand one more time but this time, instead of making the hand go in the previous direction which made it disappear with the rope last time, I want it to go all the way around and try to close the chest
Toombz — 02/13/2024 9:12 PM
Thanks for the lesson by the way. I did not know this
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:12 PM
The chest ia closed... no one has been able to open it as touching it seems to teleport them
Toombz — 02/13/2024 9:14 PM
Okay my bad. I thought the chest was open.
In that case, I use my movement and action to move a full 40ft in the direction of the goblin as well, using my bonus action to move my spiritual weapon 20ft in the direction of the Goblin too
And end my turn
Since I can only move 20ft, I'm guessing with my action too, I can only move a maximum of 40ft?
That said, I believe it's the Goblin's turn
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:18 PM
Jip
The goblin will again use his Nimble Escape to disengage as a bonus action and then move 60ft as action and movement.

Everyone continuing the chase?
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 9:24 PM
Supposing I catch up to the others by now? If it's 60ft away can I still hit it with a spell?
Jarrod — 02/13/2024 9:25 PM
if he is just gonna run no point at the moment for peridot, could catch him but could possibly run to block him
Jarrod — 02/13/2024 9:25 PM
You may be able to but from the looks of it maybe not
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:27 PM
Maybe... depends on the spell and due to the lack of light the roll will probably be at disadvantage.
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 9:29 PM
Can I try levitate on the goblin?
With disadvantage*
Toombz — 02/13/2024 9:31 PM
Yes we will continue. As discussed earlier, this is the leave no witnesses mob🤣🤣 is that our official name?
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:31 PM

Unfortunately not
Traded it for my shell😅
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:34 PM
Since it is darkness... you won't be able to cast Levitate on the goblin as it requires you to see the target
If we are continuing I guess it is back up at Pizza
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 9:36 PM
Hmm ice knife doesn't require sight
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:38 PM

Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 9:38 PM

Jarrod — 02/13/2024 9:39 PM
but wait its pizza's turn
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:46 PM
There is one thing to keep in mind... RAW says that if you want to attack a creature with a non-lethal strike it must be a melee attack as you are not ablento control the "damage" with a ranged attack  and even less so with a magical attack.

So if you wanted to interrogate the goblin... you might run into a problem if you hit him with like a fire bolt or what-not... If on the other hand you are just pissed off, then ranged attack would be your best bet to catch up to him.
Arden's Entangle or Spike growth could actually be your best bet to stop him
On a side note... how is everybody looking on spell slots amd health...?
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 9:49 PM
On my last spell....got cantrips tho....healthwise o. 16
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:49 PM

Toombz — 02/13/2024 9:50 PM
Pizza are you awake?
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 9:51 PM
Wanted to search it after a rest but thought we were catching the goblin first
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 9:52 PM
On a side side side note... you know from the info you gathered that this is a supply post or outpost... meaning there is always movement of goblins in and out of this place
Toombz — 02/13/2024 9:58 PM
Pizza, it's your turn, and you may wanna start running too🤣🤣 we also need to get Enyawd out ASAP.
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 10:01 PM
On a side side side side note... if you are trying to kill the goblin because you are scared he might tell other goblins... consider the fact that you were ambushed when you got here, you didn't catch these goblins by surprise 🤔
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 10:05 PM
In that case hear me out....we go back to the room @Deformiter (Arden) walls off the door with thorns and we rest up and spell up....chasing the goblin may get some of us killed  🤔
Deformiter (Arden) — 02/13/2024 10:07 PM
Yea, my plan has been to cast entangle on him when in range - I was in range actually earlier...but I misunderstood how far away he was from us. I could definitely stop him with spike growth though on my next turn. Has 150ft reach and I have darkvision (although I can only see up to 60ft)
Alternatively, we can retreat, block up the doorway and then rest and heal up
Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:11 PM
Agreed. The DM putting things into context that we were ambushed does change the whole witness thing. And we still have an open door to a section no one knows what it holds
Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:12 PM
Where is the open door located? In the section where the Goblin is or where I currently am now?
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 10:13 PM
Both those spells doesn't say you need line of sight or to see the area... In my opinion you can "feel the earth" and make it appear in 90ft or 150ft whichever spell you choose if you do want to try that. He does get a save on Entangle though... and will get a perception check at disadvantage on the spike growth
Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 10:13 PM
Hey it might ge a room of nothing but with most of us pretty spent i vote we live to fight another day....I mean they obviously know we're here already....we just need to first rescue Eny

Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:21 PM

Turtlebaff420 — 02/13/2024 10:22 PM
Doubt we will be free to do alot....we just had a very loud fight in a place filled with badguys who all know we're here so our first priority should be save and then rest even if we manage to catch him we risk being exposed to the holes in the walls for longer than needed.

Do you reckon we let the Goblin go or continue pursuing?
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/13/2024 10:29 PM
I don't have dark vision so I'm full on blind in the dark, I think I fail automatically
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 10:32 PM
Your shot will only be at disadvantage... think of it this way, you listen to the footsteps of the goblin as it runs down the passage, letting an arrow fly to where you think he might be...
Getting your arrow back though... I haven't tracked ammo and I don't know if you have coz I always forget but that might be a consideration 🤔
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/13/2024 10:35 PM
Oh nice yeah then I'm killing that goblin😂 I've still got 15 arrows, the goblins keep getting in my face so I've been using daggers 90% of the time

Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:47 PM
🤣🤣 totally understandable I may also try and finish him off if I was fast enough but the room with an open door than no one knows what's in it might have a 100ft python waiting to attack us while we sleep or nothing.. Or reinforcement Goblins may already be on the way. So many possibilities
Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:47 PM

Should I put you down as undecided?
Deformiter (Arden) — 02/13/2024 10:48 PM
I just think that if I can have my turn (think I'm just after Pizza) then I could entangle/spike growth him and we could beat him to death xD
Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:48 PM
If you vote to kill the Goblin, it will make it 2-2 so you won't be the decider

PS. I don't want to chase him further - the goblins in the walls will get us
we either get him where he is, or we let him go for now
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 10:50 PM
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/13/2024 10:50 PM
Yeah I agree that I dont want to chase. Im in range so I just want to take a shot
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 10:51 PM
Thinking of the goblins in the walls... you didn't see them on your second pass through 🤔
Basically_A_Chicken — 02/13/2024 10:51 PM
I still want to get in there, but not with no hp😅

I guess it's 3-1 so far for letting the Goblin go then
Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:54 PM
Fair enough. But wanting to take the shot means we will have to go for another round of initiative
Unless the DM will allow only those who wanna chase the Goblin to make attempts and the rest of us do whatever. He'll guide us
Toombz — 02/13/2024 10:58 PM
I love this outtro.. Though I'm very disappointed no one liked the Leave No Witness Gang/Squad/Mob name suggestion. Everyone here is a hater
Setto Kaiba — 02/13/2024 10:58 PM
I have no problem splitting the scene as it were... resolving one side chasing the goblin while the rest takes it easy
Toombz — 02/13/2024 11:00 PM
Sweet. It may also make things flow a bit more easily because the crew that takes it easy can create a solution to retrieve Enyawd and all of our bonus moves and actions can be bundled together into one fast action that gets him out🦾😎
Could I use my spiritual weapon for example to tie a rope to it and it hover above the pit, Enyawd grab on, and then I move it 20ft every round while at the same time the crew that decided to take it easy also pull the maximum distance they can? He'll be out in like 1 round🤣🤣
If Spiritual Weapon is pulling 20ft per round as my bonus action, and 3 of us (or more) pull as well, we may cover 100ft in a round
Toombz — 02/13/2024 11:15 PM
Enyawd also pulling himself up would add to the distance covered 
Ky — Yesterday at 10:05 AM
Tova would like to try capture or kill the goblin that is getting away, it's just one less that could attack alter then. But yes, they do know we are here already and so I guess it doesn't matter really 🙈
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:27 AM
Think of it this way it's a great revenge mini arc. He's going to go run to his buddies who already know we're here so might as well retreat for the mean time, rest up and then adventure on. By the time they rally on us we will be ready and hopefully lvl5 by then.....ey @Setto Kaiba 😉😉
I mean we fought pretty well in there 🤔🤔🤔
Burger — Yesterday at 10:43 AM

Toombz — Yesterday at 11:10 AM
It's super chilled Ky. I totally understand because you guys are in range to kill it this round. @Setto Kaiba already said he's willing to entertain having two groups of people: one group trying to get Enyawd out and the other trying to kill the Goblin.
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:11 AM
I think it's your turn next Pizza. What are you gonna do? 
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:30 AM
Ok who's all on team goblin and who's on team retreaval
Jarrod — Yesterday at 11:30 AM
Peridot will chase he is the fastest
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:32 AM
Enyawd needs my levitate so il head down to the pit so long through the chest and then cast levitate just before I splat
Toombz — Yesterday at 11:50 AM
So far, you, Arden and I are team retrieval, Ae'lun doesn't wanna chase but he's in range so wants to take the shot so he's team Goblin I guess.. Tov is also team Goblin, so is Peridot.. Only Pizza and Enyawd who we don't know what they wanna do
I guess Enyawd is team retrieval by default🤣🤣
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:57 AM
Ayt team@Deformiter (Arden) traps it with some vines while @Ky tova and @Jarrod peridot take it out. Il go down to Enyawd as levitate carry upto 500lbs so I should be able to lift him fine on my shell. @Toombz "Do you have dark vision lad? " @Basically_A_Chicken Ae'lun is blind so you take on close combat if need be and @Toombz Providing you have dark vision or if pizza has you can take up positions on either side of the pit to fend off any possible goblins wanting to take cheap shots🤔.... sound like a plan?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 11:59 AM
I'm just going to try and hit it with an arrow if it hits it hits if it misses I give up😅
Burger — Yesterday at 12:03 PM
I'll help Peridot
I'll also take a shot with my long bow
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 12:08 PM
So... If I have thr plan for the goblin right it is like this...

Arden will cast Entangle or Spike Growth.
Tova and Peridot will try and move to the goblin and wack him with melee weapons.
Pizza and Au'lun will try and hit him with ranged weapons

That about right?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 12:10 PM
Yes
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 12:10 PM
For Enyawd... It looks like this...

Nero will touch the chest to be teleported and almost fall to his death but cast Levitate at the last moment. Then Nero and Enyawd will ride the Levitate up to the top while Dumbledick keeps watch for goblin attacks from the walls.
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 12:11 PM
I'll run this a little more simplified then... so Arden which one do you choose?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 12:18 PM
I'll use Spike Growth since it doesnt seem to have a Hit / DC 
Toombz — Yesterday at 12:25 PM
I don't have dark vision unfortunately. I can take up a position on a side of the pit as you request and just also take a dodge action in the case of a Goblin trying to take a cheap shot and I'll have my spiritual weapon right by me too

I was considering it but didn't want to waste it, I thought the disadvantage would make me miss for sure
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 2:38 PM
Peridot, running up, swings at the goblin but is not able to connect in the darkness... yet Au'lun shooting blindly, hoping to hit, hears as the goblin goes "arg" as the arrow hit him in the shoulder. The goblin, bleeding profusely is now staring at Tova as she readies her attack...
Nero... you run up to the chest touching it and immediately you are transported to 20ft above the pit, plummeting down into the darkness. Please just roll a d20...
Pizza coming up behind Au'lun, also using his long bow... Pizza please give me an attack roll at disadvantage (roll 2 take the lower) to see if you can hit the goblin in the dark.

Is Tova within 5ft of the goblin? I don't think she is. And if not, is there anyone in front of her? 
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:53 PM
With your movement, you're probably within range now. Also, DM said you're readying your attack so I'm guessing Tova is within 5ft.
Toombz — Yesterday at 3:53 PM
He said so in this text
So I say, if you wanna attack, attack, and then the DM will tell us if you were really within range or not when he comes back tomorrow
Or who knows.. He may be back later today
Ky — Yesterday at 3:54 PM
I have ranged spells though, so I just want to make sure. Also, I need to know if peop are in front of me. But it's not my turn yet
But he did say he's away from 15h00, so we shall see tomorrow
Toombz — Yesterday at 4:00 PM
True. Peridot may be in front of you. Oh well. Let's wait for the DM. Hopefully he's back tonight though I'm not counting on it because of this🤣🤣

Swinging with your warhammer, Tova smashes the goblin's rib cage, crushing it and killing the goblin.

Also during this time you see Enyawd and Nero ascending from the pit, Enyawd just holding onto Nero's shell. Is someone tossing Nero or Enyawd a rope to pull them out?
Ky — Today at 9:30 AM
Wait, should we tie it up and heal it enough to interrogate? Or leave him be? Can I even do that 🤔
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:35 AM
It's dead that may be a bit hard😅
@Setto Kaiba can I access my inventory while ascending? To throw someone a rope?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:57 AM
Sure
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:58 AM
If you want the strike to just knock him unconscious you can do so, it was a melee attack so you can choose if it was a killing blow or just to knock out
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 10:01 AM
Then I'd like to toss whoever is closest when the time comes to toss it.
Jarrod — Today at 10:25 AM
Once the goblin is awake peridot would like to hold his staff close to the goblins head to intimidate it to answering questions from whoever is asking them
Ky — Today at 10:25 AM
Yes, I would prefer unconscious and then tie him up and maybe we can try get some information out of him.
Someone who speaks goblin will need to ask or translate
Jarrod — Today at 10:28 AM
Peridot will be your translator
Ky — Today at 10:31 AM
Anybody have any specific questions they would like to ask?

Tova will ask where the other goblins are hiding because we know there are lot more around here.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 10:49 AM
We should ask how they are getting around(secret tunnels?trap doors). 

What lies in the next room and how much deeper does it go. It's supposed to be an outpost but other than the crates there's not much evidence that it's a outpost so there must be living quarters or storeroom of some sort...

Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 12:31 PM
Arden formulates his questions, seeking to unravel the mysteries of the tomb and the goblins' activities. Here are his questions:

    "How do we open the chest in the other room without triggering any spells or traps?"
    "What dangers await us further in the tomb?"
    "Who leads your group, and why have you been attacking the nearby town?"
    "Are there secret passages or mechanisms in this tomb that you use to move around?"
    "Where do your kin hide within these walls?"
    "Is there a central gathering place or a storage area within this outpost?"
    "Tell us about the defenses of this place. What should we be wary of?"
    "What is the purpose of your presence in this tomb?"

Arden hopes these questions will reveal the insights they need to proceed cautiously and with greater knowledge of the threats that lie ahead.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:33 PM
He can still lie remember so it may lie about the traps(sucks i dont have zone of truth) but general questions like the chest and why they are attacking are great questions 👌

Peridot, he looks at you as you ask him these questions and spits on the ground, "you and your kind will get nothing from me..."

The goblin looking repulsed at the gesture, responds "you and your companions are a sickness in this forest and you will be wiped off like shit from our feet."
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 12:55 PM
"Nero looks confused....then down at his paw and back at the goblin.... perhaps we weren't clear...from what we heard you are the disease on this land and as you can see we are far superior at eradicating you so unless the next words out your mouth are what we need they will be your last gobbo.....mark my words"

Command
1st-level enchantment. (Cleric, Paladin, Knowledge Domain, Oath of Conquest, Oath of the Crown, Order Domain, The Fiend)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V
Duration: 1 round
Description
You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn't understand your language, or if your command is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a command other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can't follow your command, the spell ends.

Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.

Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.

Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.

Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
Halt. The target doesn't move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.
At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for each slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
Spell | BR 223
Toombz — Today at 1:18 PM
Setto, you need to make a Wisdow saving throw. Maybe at disadvantage because Dumbledick has been a good boy?🤣🤣 
Toombz — Today at 1:28 PM
Actually before casting the spell, I would like to ask if Peridot can be the person who appears to be casting the spell so that he can say the command to the Goblin? 
And also ask the questions? Unless the Goblin understands the common language too 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 1:31 PM
The spell strictly says, "you speak a one word command" so it will have to be you who speaks the command.

Short rest would allow to regain some hp, spell slots, ki points as well I think then taking a long rest afterwards, in case it gets interrupted by Goblins trying to kill us and therefore we don't gain the benefits of long rest, then at least we gained the benefits of short rest

Now the dm is just toying with us
Toombz — Today at 3:26 PM
Dumbledick asks Ae'lun or Peridot what the Goblin just said and after hearing "we are hundreds", pauses his armour undressing and takes a gulp 🫨 telling Ae'lun/Peridot to trick him into exposing whether these hundreds sleep here after their day is done in this venue or are spread over all the land. Because waking up to hundreds of Goblins may be a problem 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:30 PM
"I know you are many, I've heard rumors of your army. Although I also know most of your army is up in the mountains not in this tiny cave. Unless the tunnels behind the walls are larger than they seem?"
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:39 PM
Feeling bored and frustrated the goblin won't give us anything he speaks to the group. Ayt looks like you lot have this undercontrol toss em into the pit if he wants to play silly buggers. I'm gonna head back to the room to begin fortifications for the night.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:46 PM
suggesting questions didn't count as torture, did it? 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 3:47 PM
we haven't cut him yet so I doubt it
Toombz — Today at 3:47 PM
I will join you in creating fortifications. Maybe our resident Druid could wildshape into a giant badger and begin burrowing an alternative way out of our sleeping quarters if we start hearing our fortifications being torn down? During my time in wars as a soldier, having an alternative exit unknown to the enemy was always a huge advantage 
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:48 PM
Interrogation no torture 😅
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:48 PM
No... you are good. 😁
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:49 PM
yea, just wanted to be sure 🙂
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:49 PM
I hear you but I believe he is spent and in need of rest. We will sleep in shifts those with 4 hours go first and the others take watch that way in the event of an ambush
Toombz — Today at 3:50 PM
True. But what about that pet that I saw? Would it not provide adequate watch while we all sleep? That companion sorry. Not pet
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:50 PM
Arden is able to Wild Shape one more time still - and only needs 4 hours rest to get to full strength
Setto Kaiba — Today at 3:50 PM
Where is this interrogation taking place?
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:51 PM
At the pit if not mistaken 🤔
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:51 PM
I could "pre-burrow" a hidden escape before we rest xD
Toombz — Today at 3:51 PM
Hmmmmm... Interesting!!!!
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:52 PM
Can you burrw through stone?🤔
Toombz — Today at 3:52 PM
I'm keen!!! We can barricade the room we are planning to rest in and have a new exit made in case of barricades being torn down
Toombz — Today at 3:52 PM
I believe a giant badger can. DM will confirm
Or a purple worm
Or we could just break down stone with our weapons until earth is exposed so that burrowing can take place
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:55 PM
Purple worm CR is way to high If I remember....don't have my books on me
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:55 PM
no way Arden could do Purple Worm, CR is too high - Giant Badger can possibly work, with a 10ft burrow per turn - let's wait and see 🙂
We have like 9892374 dwarves on our team, we should put them to work 😛
Toombz — Today at 3:56 PM
True that. But from what I'm seeing, the 3 of us are keen on the barricading and burrowing idea? 10ft per minute burrowing means 600ft in an hour🦾😎 and if we assist every turn, we could possibly double that because you can dig 10ft, then each of us can take a turn after you to dig some more 
We can also use the dirt from the burrowing to add to the fortifications
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 3:59 PM
I'm just wondering about the width of the burrow hole - might be a bit extreme cavey for some xD
I guess since he's a medium sized creature, anyone medium sized and smaller would fit fine
Toombz — Today at 4:00 PM
I think it's 10ft which is 3 meters tall and wide. We'll hear from @Setto Kaiba 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 4:02 PM
"oh well goblin doesn't want to talk to me either Enyawd it's all yours" can I recover my arrow if its still stuck in its shoulder?
Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:18 PM
By this time, it has been broken with all the dragging and tying up and everything 🤷‍♂️

So what is the group plan currently? Enyawd want to interrogate the goblin?
If you want to barricade the tomb... where is that happening... what are you using as barricade?
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:23 PM
So far it's myself arden and thee dragonborn. In the sarcophagai room. Using anything other than the desks(nero has a plan for those) as a base and hopefully the dirt dug up by arden if he doesn't have vines.
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 4:24 PM
Can entangle be used to vine up the doorway (once everyone is on this side of the door of course) ?
Toombz — Today at 4:28 PM
Yep. We'll use the sarcophagi, tiles on the floor if any, the alter.. Anything we can get our hands on and use entangle to put everything together
Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:32 PM
It'll have some holes but can work good enough for a goblin not to pass through
Toombz — Today at 4:36 PM
What do you guys say? Cool with barracading the room while burrowing to a safe exit which will produce more sand to barricade with until we take a long rest? We don't all need to barricade and help burrow, some can rest. What do you guys say? 
We can burrow towards the surface as long as 600ft is enough
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 4:48 PM
I'm in, unless there's an alternative plan that someone can suggest
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:49 PM
The tunnel is only as a defacto alternative escape route. We can rather brake down the barrier to get out as arden has pointed out size may be an issue not to mention if you know about crude tunnels you'd know they aren't fortified and can collapse killing everyone so we only use it in no way out scenario. Agreed?
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 4:51 PM
There's also the other hallway that we havn't been down (passed the two illusionary tiles) which may also be a cause for concern if we spend the night in the main hall with the chest.
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 4:54 PM
That's what the desks are for. As long as there's no floor in that passage we should be safe....then when we are rested we can put them desks across and it should be long enough to cover the gaps and we can use it as a bridge
Toombz — Today at 5:05 PM
Okay I'm gonna just say we barricade and take a long rest. Ae'lun's companion can keep watch for us perhaps and scream if we're in danger of attack? That's all that we seem to agree on so far without objection since the borrowing idea doesn't seem to fly, though support could be done for the tunnel in an improvised manner based on Dumbledick's military past experiences with tunneling, but let's stick to barricades and long rest.
Toombz — Today at 5:24 PM

Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 7:12 PM
Ae'luns going to go collect SG4's ear to add to his string of ears, "we should take turns keeping lookout again if we're going to camp here, this place is far from safe"
Toombz — Today at 7:16 PM
Agreed. I'm very nervous about camping here but it seems no one is really making any other suggestions for us to discuss. I'm cool with spending the whole night discussing whether we should camp here, or in another room in this cave or if we should leave the cave altogether.  Anything, though right now I'm basically 100% sold on camping here so long as we have fortifications even if I am nervous about the potential of 100s of Goblins😬
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 7:23 PM
"there are 100s of goblins no matter where we camp, and this tomb is a supply point of theirs. Clearing it out would at the very least weaken their hold on the area"
Toombz — Today at 7:26 PM
Fair point. But maybe people are set on resting here because as of right now, there's no Goblins attacking us and if we leave, we may get attacked again and some here are low on HP and their special abilities like sorcery points or ki points, wild forms, etc... But you raise a very good point. This is a supply point of theirs so it is very risky to settle here and maybe we should have a discussion of whether we're sure about settling here. I'm open
Toombz — Today at 7:28 PM
I like the clearing it out idea though. Brilliant. Personally, I was gonna say we try and even make this place like our fortress/stronghold while we still dominate it 🤣🤣 but that's just me. I wanna hear from everyone else about what they feel is best. Side note, I can give 5 HP to 3 players EACH. Who is low on HP or just needs 5 HP?

Toombz — Today at 8:35 PM
Good question. I think they're both rest.
Toombz — Today at 8:35 PM
Rest
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 8:37 PM
As the dust settles and the weight of their trials presses heavily upon their shoulders, Arden, looks over at the weary group, his keen eyes glistening with the reflection of their shared toil. With the foresight of one who has seen much beyond the veil of the natural world, he speaks, his voice a blend of the ancient earth and the whispering winds, "In the heart of the wild, there is both peril and sanctuary. Let us weave our rest within the embrace of the earth, for in its depths, we may find respite from the claws of our adversaries. As the roots entangle to protect their domain, so shall we bind our strengths, guarding each other through the cloak of night. For in the morrow, the cycle of struggle and survival shall begin anew, guided by the wisdom of the land and the resolve in our hearts."
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 8:38 PM
one is rest and the other is rest but with ✨style✨
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 8:41 PM
As Arden's gaze shifts towards Dumbledick, the weariness of battle momentarily fades from his visage, replaced by a semblance of respect and gratitude. He approaches the new friend with a nod, acknowledging the gravity of their shared ordeal. "Greetings friend, what is your name?" Arden begins, his voice resonant with the timbre of ancient stone, yet soft as the rustle of leaves in a hushed forest. "I am Arden, your valor in the face of darkness has not gone unnoticed. It is rare to find one who stands so steadfast when shadows loom large. For your efforts during these dire times, I extend my thanks. May our paths intertwine like the roots of the great oaks, strong and supportive, as we forge ahead in the journey that fate has laid before us."
Toombz — Today at 8:57 PM
Greetings my fellow adventurer. Your words are well crafted and soothe the ears as delightfully as an orchestra of angels giving praise to my clerical deity for victory over our enemies and thus the guaranteed safety of our loved ones. My name is Dumbledick, he with the dick that dumbles. I appreciate your kind words but would also point out that all of you fought valiantly against our brain dead foes today. I thank you all for your hospitality and trust though you do not know me and for all you know, I may be planning to slit your throats in your sleep and take all your valuables. But rest assured, my intentions are pure, and I seek only for the destruction of evil. Apologies for my dark sense of humor or my use of dark metaphors/examples, it is a byproduct of my years as a soldier seeing unspeakable horrors that I have become desensitized to my dark humor and metaphors. If there is any way I may gain your favour and trust, please do not hesitate to let me know. May I get to know all of your names oh great adventurers?
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 8:57 PM
with the dick that dumbles 🤣 💀
Toombz — Today at 8:59 PM
I don't even know what that means. It just sounded cool in my head🤣🤣
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 9:07 PM
Arden, with a sage nod to Dumbledick, begins the introductions, his voice carrying the weight of ancient forests and the calm of a moonlit glade. "Indeed, Dumbledick, your presence amongst us is a beacon in these shadowed times. Allow me to introduce you to our fellowship, woven from the very fabric of courage and resolve. First, we have Tova, our steadfast Dwarven Cleric, whose faith is as unyielding as the mountains from whence she hails. Beside her stands Pizza, a noble Dragonborn Paladin, a recent ally, whose valor burns bright. Peridot, our Wood Elf Monk, moves with the grace of the wind, their strength hidden beneath the calm. Nero, our Turtle Sorcerer, wise and ancient, though he may benefit from a sojourn to clearer waters. Enyawd, our Mountain Dwarf Rogue, sharp and shrewd, his wit as keen as his blade. And Ae'lun, our Air Genasi Ranger, whose arrows fly true, guided by the whispers of the air itself." Clearing his throat, Arden gestures to each in turn, beckoning them to welcome Dumbledick into their circle. "Let us extend our hands, not just in greeting, but as a sign of unity against the darkness that seeks to divide us. Together, we stand stronger, each thread of our tale, interwoven."
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:13 PM
Enyawd listens silently and at the end says "what's a wit? My arrow?"
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:15 PM
As you all are standing there making introductions and preparing yourselves for a rest, you feel the temperature in the room change, the air grows colder and a mysterious mist flows from the room beyond...
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 9:16 PM
Thats not good
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 9:18 PM

Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:21 PM
Remember to add your healing...
So tell me, my dear players... What fortifications have you made and where? 😈 
Ky — Today at 9:26 PM
Tova will lend her strength where it is needed.

She will greet Dumbledick, but she's not quite as welcoming as Arden seems to be of the strangers... She is wary if these strangers and where they all seem to be appearing from
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 9:26 PM
Arden has begun the entanglement of the doorway into the main hall, with thick, tree-stump line vines, layering them as best as he can to prevent any gaps large enough for anything to pass through
Toombz — Today at 9:26 PM
"What a stupendous introduction to your companions that you have made. Are you a renowned poet of some kind? Because you have quite the way with your words and.." 
Dumbledick pauses as the temperature in the room changes, air grows colder, and takes a defensive dodge position. He grips his shield a little bit tighter 
Toombz — Today at 9:27 PM
We also used the altar and sarcophagus materials and any stone/tile from the floor
Toombz — Today at 9:29 PM
Dumbledick appreciates Tova's greeting and chuckles as he remembers their first encounter as they were back to back in battle and his stupid line "enemy of your enemy is your friend?"🤣 since she's a dwarf, I guess it's back to calf/thigh?🤣🤣 
Deformiter (Arden) — Today at 9:32 PM
Arden acknowledges Dumbledick's compliment with the grace of one who has traversed the depths of understanding. "I am but a student of nature, seeking the harmony of existence. The wisdom I share is drawn from Zivara, guiding us towards unity with all beings. My words merely echo the eternal truths of our interconnectedness, a reflection of the divine dance in which we all partake."
Arden will collect a few of the dead roots and kindling from the floor and walls, place them into the center of their proposed camp site and use Produce Flame to create a small campfire to keep the cool air at bay.
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 9:33 PM
Ae'lun nods to Dumbledick "Arden here has been keeping all good mushrooms and herbs for himself"
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 9:35 PM
Enyawd looks at Pizza and something about him reminds him of Patty, who may have been kin.
Ky — Today at 9:36 PM
Tova feels the temperature change and looks around seeing the strange mist. 'there is evil here', ready yourself. There is still undead among us, I can feel it in my Dwarven bones. My clericy senses are tingling'

Tova will ready sacred flame 
Basically_A_Chicken — Today at 9:40 PM
"Looks like he may have been sharing"
Toombz — Today at 9:41 PM
That may explain the smoothness of his tongue. Only a good set of shrooms could make someone such a magnificent weaver of words. It all makes sense now🤣
Setto Kaiba — Today at 9:42 PM
The time you have spent getting to know each other and doing some light activity would suffice for a short rest... you may take some hit dice for healing... those who get some stuff back on a short rest can do so...

how do I know if I get anything else back on a short rest? o_O
oh and how do I get it to roll the dice? it isnt rolling xD
Ky — Today at 9:49 PM
Check under your feats and traits, it should say short or long rest. I don't think druids get spell slots back on short rest but I could be wrong
You should get wild shape back though
Toombz — Today at 9:50 PM
Roll 1d8 per level you are as a druid and add that to your hit points. You regain all uses of Wild Shape

Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two 1st-level slots.
