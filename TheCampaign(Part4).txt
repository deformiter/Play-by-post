Tova Truestorm casts Guiding Bolt!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (17) + 4 = 21
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

Tova Truestorm casts Spiritual Weapon!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (20) + 4 = 24
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

So you hit him with your spiritual weapon... but narrowly miss with your guiding bolt as it just shoots wide.

This brings Arden up... @Deformiter (Arden)  are you up and going again?

Nero Ebérloch casts Fire Bolt!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (13) + 4 = 17
Damage: 1d10 (1) = 1
Effect
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

The rest of you see Nero being dragged underwater, in a frenzy of crocodile and blood. The darkness, mist, blood and splashing water makes it hard to see what is happening as Nero is dragged away...

Dumbledick ignores Pipers who ignored his Message spell and didn't whisper back and instead heads straight for the the 4-inches taller than him metal machine and marvel's at it's fine craftsmanship by looking it up and down, sideways and every way possible. 

"Sweet mother of Mordain" (the primary deity of the dwarves & Forge Domain clerics and by default, Dumbledick's deity as he is part Forge Domain Cleric in addition to being a sorcerer). "Not since my military days when I took a trip to a very wealthy and powerful arms manufacturer for some training have I observed such magnificence. Did you make this uh... Apologies, what is your name?"
Dumbledick asks as his annoyance from her lack of a response to his Message spell leaves his mind in place of excitement

Her head tweeks at Enyawds comment and she then climbs up to Dingos head and lays her palm on it. Using Dingo as a vessel she quietly channels her voice through it. "My pops help me create Dingo when I was a wee one we worked on him for years" .....she pauses..." he's not a simple suit of Armour.....he's sentient and exists to protect and defend me on my adventure to become a greater inventor than even the old man himself.... Her hand drops....whispers to herselfI won't let you down pops.

Now what was it you were on about?....
Toombz

Yesterday at 1:04 PM
Now that he knows that she's not using the Message spell and is simply speaking telepathically, he communicates back saying "Why didn't you just respond and chose instead to simply ignore? I don't know where you are from, but it is considered rude in these parts to not reply when asked a question. For my part, I apologise as I did not know the palm was your attempt at greeting. It seemed as though you were attempting to shut me up and stop me from examining the fine creation you have there. I guess you ignoring my questions and me ignoring your palm gesture makes us even"

Dumbledick says as he approaches the campfire and begins eating some of Nero's delicious biltong for breakfast and offers some too saying "as we eat this, let us remember our fallen friend Nero, a fine chef and a brave warrior though I initially though of him as cowardly. May his soul rest well and find peace. What a great lad he was" 
He also telepathically offers the new adventurer some biltong and says "try it. most delicious snack you've ever had"

We are a quiet folk who prefer to communicate in this manner and being known for our creations as to uphold our refined craftsmanship mysteries. Forgive me if I apposed on your customs.

She nervously takes a piece and waddles over to dingo who lifts her up. She tears off a small piece and inserts it into dingos mouth for analysis. Hmm amphibian? She asks? Interesting.....doesn't seem to harbor any bacteria or poison so it should be safe. She then gives it a sniff and a small nibble.

She finishes her ration and then tells dumble" dingo and I will rest in the tree line as to not startle the others when they wake". She picks up 2 pepples off the ground thinkers with them a bit and then taps on it a few times before it starts glowing. She tosses one sending stone towards dumble. "Here use this to give me a ring when yah ready for my grand reveal"

As the rest of our group awakens, Dumbledick uses the sending stone to awaken the new adventurer. He tells the group "We have a new baby Tova with the greatest piece of machinery I have ever seen. A marvel to behold. They are both not hostile but she is not from around here. She may ignore your words because where she's from, actions speak louder than words. So fist bumps and high fives are her communication". Then he offers them some biltong in Nero's memory

Tiny sees the halfling and the metal construct and happily waves and shouts "Hello friends!, Wait was that you in my head just now? That was weird." Tiny then walks up to the metal construct as Enyawd mentions it should fit Tiny, he takes out his saucepan and gently taps the side of the construct Clang Clang then chuckles "Man that sounds so cool, I wish I had one of these." Tiny then turns to the halfling "Hello friend"

"What's your name friend? I'm Tiny, I like your... thing" pointing at the construct 
Turtlebaff420

Yesterday at 4:56 PM
Piper places her hand in tinys giant hand. Apon making contact she links with her mind with Tiny. "Greetings big fella....pardon the intrusion my kind greet this way. It is a way of showing each other trust. This here is my good mate Dingo my pops and I built him when I was a wee one to keep me company on my travels and he's been my protector ever since."

Ae'lun who's pretty much kneeling at this point looks confusedly at the little one he did not notice before. his bow is still in his hand but its basically just hanging there with a very loose grip. "hello..." he timidly holds out his hand in response
Turtlebaff420

Yesterday at 5:28 PM
Piper places her hand in her palm " g'day names piper....sorry to hear about your friend." She keeps glancing at Ae'luns bow. She pauses mid conversation and points at it. " you mind if i fix? She gestures to the bow for him to allow her to look at it.

Yesterday at 5:37 PM
"He..." Ae'lun pauses "He was a good man, a brave man" his stare drifting off into the distance for a second... Snapping back to reality when Piper mentions his bow "fix? Is it broken?" He considers for a second then curiously hands it over
Turtlebaff420
 — 
Yesterday at 5:50 PM
(Pending DM @Setto Kaiba s approval.)"Yes yes fix I fix." She graciously takes the oversized bow and hoists it above her head and waddles over to the nearest rock. She takes out her tinkering tools and begins tightening and tweaking....magical like sparks begin to resonate from it and elven like runes being to glow  ingraved along its length. 

She pulls back the string to test it then smiles as she marvels at her handy work....she waddles back over to Ae'lun and hands him back the bow. She looks him in the eye and almost as if she were seeing through his eyes looking  at the bow he hears her voice resonate in his head once again.... "There fixed....I present the repeating "Neo" bow(name pending). 

side note (NB requires 1 hr of attunement by @Basically_A_Chicken ) It is permanently now infused with the repeating shot infusion:

 This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it’s used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.

If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Piper speaks to Ae'lun telepathically. " Aye no problem bud I sensed the pain in your eyes earlier and thought bringing you a keepsake to remind you of your friend so a part of him will forever be with you."

﻿Arden takes out and map and after some careful consideration and speaking to Peridot he agrees that the path to the left seems like a better and more reliable route up and out of the swamp.

Moving on, you spend the good part of the day moving through the swamp and as the swampy terrain starts to change to more rocky hillside and then more mountainous  areas with plants becoming less of an obstacle you can move along faster.

After about 4 hours of traveling you finally reach a good vantage point overlooking most of the swamp and to the other end you see the mountain that is marked on the map.

It is hard to tell feom this distance, but there appears to be some movement upon the hill and close to the marked area.

In between you and the marked area is a narrow stretch leading from this side of the mountain along the edge and then through what appears to be a cave and then another narrow ledge leading up in the other side to the cave that you belive is the stronghold of the Grey Skull Goblins.

Standing there, you begin to ponder the scale of the force you might be facing...the terrain itself favors them...

With all this in mind... what is the parties plan of action?

Arden, taking the lead through the treacherous terrain towards the stronghold of the Grey Skull Goblins, remains vigilant, his senses attuned to the natural world around him and the subtle shifts in the environment. He pauses, his keen eyes scanning the narrow stretch that lies ahead, contemplating the challenges of navigating through the cave and across the precarious ledge. "Peridot," Arden calls softly, ensuring his voice carries only to those closest to him. "The path ahead demands our utmost caution. Let us employ our skills to ascertain the safest route." With a focused mind, he suggests they perform a combined effort: Arden offers to use his enhanced perceptiveness to reveal safer paths, while seeking Peridot's keen insights. "Together, we can ensure the safety of our companions and navigate with precision." Arden stands ready, his resolve as unwavering as the ancient trees of the forest.
Setto Kaiba
 — 
Today at 9:07 AM
There aren't any tall trees in this area... plants here are dry grasslands and the trees are scarce. 

To get a better view of the force you might be facing you could try and scout from here. You could continue on along the narrow path, through the cave (tunnel if you will) and out the other side to get closer.

All these options do have the possibility of the goblins being able to spot you. They might have scouts or a watch.
Setto Kaiba

Today at 9:09 AM
From here there does not seem to be a better way of moving forward than along the narrow path, though this might change once you reach the cave / tunnel.
Deformiter (Arden)
 — 
Today at 9:10 AM
Gazing across the rugged terrain that lay before them, Arden turns to his Dwarven comrades. "Friends, the mountains ahead hold secrets known perhaps only to those familiar with their embrace. Do any among you, versed in the lore of the mountains, feel called to guide our steps?" His request, a testament to his trust in their collective wisdom and strength, invites his companions to lead, acknowledging the depth of knowledge and experience that only those connected to the mountain's heart possess.
Toombz

Seems like we have no other choice than the cave or tunnel but maybe the more stealthy players should go first? I have the Message cantrip that stretches to 120ft so you don't have to worry about the noise from my armour and if necessary I can extend it to 240ft.. That's just my suggestion @everyone
Toombz
 — 
Today at 9:48 AM
I will be right behind them around 120ft or so.. And when I speak the Message Spell into your mind, you'll respond in a silent whisper only I can hear so you'll maintain your stealth 
Turtlebaff420
 — 
Today at 9:57 AM
Not sure what good the message cantrip will do they will have the elevation so they could spot us before we even make it 240ft. If someone has pass without trace or invisibility that would be a better fit

So... You are basically on the side of the mountain looking to towards the Goblin Cave on the side of the next mountain about 2 to 2.5 miles away. To get there you must travel along a narrow pathway running alongside the mountain you are on and to a tunnel or cave that is about 700ft to 900ft away and then potentially on the other side of this cave or tunnel is a narrow path leading up and and the Goblin Cave.

Peridot, you start to walk off in the direction of the narrow ledge leading towards the tunnel. As you make your way down slowly and carefully, making sure to step quietly and not be seen you come about 1/4 of the way to where you can see the tunnel entrance when you hear something... movement... you stop and look around trying to find a way to avoid detection when you feel something grabbing you and pulling you behind a little patch of vines hanging from the rock face. As the figure grabs you it tella you to be quiet as you hear footsteps just a few feet beyond, around the bend.

Okay I could do two things but Peridot knowing they going towards his party will follow the goblins untill he is about 90ft from the party and then dash past to warm them. ( I can move 135ft in a round if I move dash and step of the wind)

Deformiter (Arden)

Yesterday at 5:56 PM
Arden, amidst the unfolding events and the palpable tension as Peridot ventured into the unknown, found a moment of solitude to reconnect with the natural world around him. Drawing from the essence of Zivara's teachings on the interconnectedness of all life, he quietly observes the play of shadows and light across the rugged terrain, seeking wisdom in the silent dance of nature. With a deep breath, he focuses on the subtle energies of the earth beneath his feet, feeling the ancient strength of the mountains and the resilient spirit of the plants that dared to grow in such a stark landscape. In this moment of communion with the earth, Arden seeks not only to understand the messages of the natural world but also to impart his own energies in a silent offering of gratitude and respect. As he stands there, the boundaries between himself and the land blurred, reminding him that even in times of uncertainty, there is a profound unity and purpose to be found in the embrace of the natural world.

Andil wouldn't follow Peridot as she is pretty sure she'd fall off the edge of the narrow ledge (or get stepped on if she wildshaped into a mouse or something similar.) She would try to keep following the goblins from a safe distance.

Dumbledick, while remaining completely still, is repeatedly casting the Message cantrip at its normal range of 120 ft with the target being Peridot as I suggested earlier. He whispers the spell's words softly every time while also keeping his ears open for any incoming footsteps or sounds not originating from the group.

Dumbledick will repeatedly be asking Peridot with his Message cantrip: "Peridot, it's Dumbledick here. Were you spotted and are now running back?

As you emerge from the vines and follow the goblins, staying 40ft behind them... You move for about 150ft before you see as one of them stops and says to the other in goblin "Stop... I hear something moving" and then turns around seeing Peridot and possibly Andil behind him.

What would you like to do?

@Enyawd Nightbeard are you gonna tell the group about this? Because once you do, Dumbledick is gonna make a suggestion that involves Pass Without Trace, Arden & Enyawd while the "shiny mirror" Dumbledick, Tova & Tinman wait for both Peridot & this second explorer group come back with intel. But of course, there are other options like all of us staying put, or some deciding to check up on Peridot since we may be getting anxious/worried. Just opening the door for discussion & of course the first part of this message involves Enyawd officially telling the group what he sees😂

You can see the ledge that you all will have to take to get to the tunnel it snakes around the edge of the mountain slighly down and then you go through the tunnel and then up again with a similar ledge on the other side... the ledge is about 2ft wide.
DM advice... It might be a good idea to plan here what you are gonna do as you find yourself close to what your characters believe to be the hideout of 100 or more grey skull goblins.

Arden, gazing at the narrow ledge stretching ahead, understands the precariousness of their path. The surefootedness required to traverse such terrain sparks an idea within him. In a moment of quiet resolve, he chooses to embrace the form most suited for this challenge. With the party's eyes away from him, he seamlessly transitions, his form reshaping into that of a goat. Renowned for their impeccable agility and unerring balance on the most treacherous mountain paths, his goat form offers the perfect embodiment of stability and confidence needed for the journey ahead. Transformed, Arden bleats, as if to gain the attention of his party and take the lead, he nods his head in the direction of the ledge, he moves forward and sets a steady pace for his companions to follow should they decide to.

Dumbledick, because of his noisy armor, would stay in position because he doesn't wanna compromise their position. Also, because he knows this is a Goblin stronghold, he will be weary that there could be hundreds of them so unless theres a way to stealthily enter the cave, he won't wanna take any chances until there is certainty. If he sees a ton of goblins coming, he will do what he did when he saw dozens of crocodiles and that is run. If Peridot cries out for help, he will go help first before retreating but he will hope Peridot will coming running back at the first sign of trouble (50 goblins coming at him😂 ). That's currently his state of mind.

Meanwhile...

With the goblin up first, he will loosen a flask of oil from around his belt and throw it onto the ground infront of him... 10ft away, covering 5ft in some sort of oil.

Using his movement he will duck down... effectively being prone for mechanical terms, ending his turn. The terrain is now slippery and will require a Dex Check to pass over without slipping.

The second Goblin will mutter a few words, using his bonus action to cast a spell... and draw an arrow from his quiver, instantly lightning the tip as he draws this arrow. With the Goblin infront of him prone he is able to get a shot towards the oil and will attempt to light the oil with his arrow...

With Arden and Enyawd leading... coming around you will now be able to see this, although not clearly but you will be able to make out that Peridot is engaged with two goblins and a giant spider.
Everyone is obviously single file as you are making your way towards them on this ledge.

As Andil reverts back to human form, she falls onto the ledge. Peridot manages to get out of the way, but Andil isn't able to hold on and is now dangling from the edge, barely hanging on... her hands slipping.

Since Andil fell, the goblin will not be able to take his 2nd shot, but now Peridot has to make a choice... attack the goblin, or attempt to save his new comrade 🤔

In goat form Arden could probably make it up the side 60ft to the top where they are getting some boulders ready...but that would put you up alone with 2 goblins (that you know of) and potentially more (that you don't know of). It would probably not be possible while carrying someone.

Everyone makes their way back, following the 2ft wide ledge to the outcrop looking over to the mountain beyond at the entrance of what you believe to be the goblin stronghold. As Peridot arrives, the rest of you see behind him a Tiefling... 

Perhaps now getting more of an idea of what the party might face when you continue... what are you doing?

Ky — 04/23/2024 10:38 AM
Tova will make her way to Peridot, not even seeing the Tiefling and while she is moaning at him about going off by himself and not telling anyone and how could he make her worry like that etc etc, she will also be checking his injuries. She will cast healing word at 2nd level

Since Enyawd told us about the shortcut, Dumbledick's mind is trained on that. He believes that the group should head over there but he is paranoid that they've lost the element of surprise.  Whatever happens though, he would like Peridot at full strength before they attempt it. Dumbledick tells Peridot "Glad you're okay man and I see you've made a friend"

Looking around for a way to get ro the higher lesge... Peridot, Enyawd and Ae'lun you notice that the only way to get higher is to go out onto the 2ft ledge and then try to climb up to the ledge above you. You also see that while you have been making your way back and now standing deliberating on what to do, the goblins have organized themselves and is ready to droo boulders on anyone moving on the ledge.

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:42 AM
Piper suggests to the group that her and dingo have this covered using her intelligence she has studied the trajectory of the Boulder if she is able to catapult it she can reverse the trajectory and return to sender.

"Dingo mate you follow the group of climbers, activate deflection shield protocol." As soon as the second Boulder is triggered on one of the party Dingo will step in and deal with it allowing the climbers to get to the top unchallenged. 

Sound like a plan? @everyone (edited)

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:20 PM
Just so everyone has this clear... You still need to move along the 2ft ledge for atleast 300ft. While doing this there is a ledge above (between 150ft and 250ft, slighlty more indented) that has 2 goblins on with massive boulders that is ready to roll this down on whoever moves there.

After the 300ft, there is a tunnel leading to the mountain accross from you. This is another 400ft long 2ft wide ledge leading to a large cave opening you believe to be the goblin hideout. On the way there (on that 2ft ledge) is a crevasse that appears to be a side tunnel leading into the side of the cave instead of the main entrance. 

Andil, having escaped from this cave found another tunnel that leads down, via a waterfall that flows through the cave system instead of to the next 2ft ledge on the other side.

As the party deliberates their next move amidst the looming threat of goblin ambush, Arden, still in his goat form to maintain a low profile, continues to play his part flawlessly. He nibbles nonchalantly on the sparse vegetation sprouting from the rocky cracks, embodying the essence of a mountain goat, heedless to the perils that await. With each casual glance around, Arden assesses the terrain and the position of his companions, ensuring he is ready to shift back to his true form and defend the group should the need arise.

Tova will say that she can cast fog cloud above them which would heavily obscure them while they try to cross the ledge. If they hug the ledge and move that way, hopefully the rocks will miss them going down and the goblins wont be able to aim exactly for them which may also give them a chance. The spell area however is only 40ft and we wont be able to all move together. So maybe two smaller parties? Fog cloud lasts for an hour. If Tova is in front, she can also cast Thunder Wave at anything coming from in front of them. As a goat, Adren might not need cover as he is inconspicuous but is obviously welcome to join under the cover if we went with this. 

It's not fool proof but Tova is out of ideas. (edited)

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:20 AM
If we go with this pipers plan is out the window as fog cloud would give her and dingo just as much aiming disadvantage with the boulder plan. We need a decision fast

Ky — Today at 2:21 AM
How are you going to catapult the boulders back?

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 2:35 AM
Hang on what about this ...Don't need to necessarily bounce  them back I can choose the line of trajectory I can aim it that it shoots off the side of the mountain and dingo has a deflection ability so he was going to catch the Boulder and just shrug it off the mountain. 

I suggest we split just for a bit. Two teams the ledge group and the ambush group. Group 1 sneaks under fog past the drop point(tova, perridot, tiny,dumble and au'lun). Team 2 (piper, dingo, arden and andil) follow close behind to take care if the boulders aimed at the fog. 

Team 1 needs to move fast no hesitation. Get to the undiscovered route and hold cover for team 2. Team 1 climbers(perridot and tiny especially) to find a way up and take out the goblins while team 2 distract them with ranged attack.

Ky — Today at 2:49 AM
How is Dingo planning on catching a massive boulder running/falling down the mountain at a speed? This doesnt make sense to me . I am happy to stand back and let you try, but it doesnt make logical sense to me, though to be fair, I know nothing about physics so if I am being stupid here, please let me know 

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 3:00 AM
Piper was aiming to go first to act as the target so when dingo goes to protect piper by deflecting the Boulder targeted at her then use catapult to fling the second Boulder away (catch might not have been the best choice of words).....I'm just throwing in alternatives we need to get moving... weather it's a bad plan or we choose another we can't just keep sitting around wasting time.

Great, then, I have a new idea because I think we are over thinking this. If nobody agrees with this, I will step back and let Piper and dingo do their thing. 

If Tova can move within 120ft to the first one and try take it out with guiding bolt, and I do say try, then maybe an archer can move with her and try take out the other one with a bow and arrow? We are assuming there are only 2 goblins and we should be within range for us to take them out individually for anyone with a ranger weapon or spell. We attack and then move back to stand as close to the cliff wall as possible avoiding the spots directly under the boulders  

This does possibly leave us open to attacks from other weapons though but piper will be open to that as well with her plan

Far enough tht I am within 120ft range of the closest goblin. Not 100% sure how far that would be. Tova will have her shield up, and ready to hold it above her head if they look like they will attack with other weapons and her other hand free to cast

Setto Kaiba — Today at 4:07 AM
You step out, making your way along the ledge, hugging the side of the mountain to about 90ft away from the group being 60ft from being below the boulder. Though it is hard to see you manage to catch a glimps of the 1st goblin who runs to behind the boulder ready to push it down...

On the farside of the ledge, 210ft away... you see a single goblin running from the tunnel ahead and onto the 2ft ledge coming towards you.

If it avoids him being hit again sure
[7:07 AM]
Not sure he can defend and hold me at the same time though so id be on his shoulder

Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:08 AM
If you share his space below Tova is still in your way to fire directly at the goblin...
[7:09 AM]
You could fire up and over her, but since that is a more "tricky" shot to make he will atleadt gain +2 for 1/4 cover

@Setto Kaiba

Turtlebaff420 — Today at 7:10 AM
He should tower well over tova? How is she still in the way ?

Setto Kaiba — Today at 7:11 AM
If you are on Dingo yes... I mean if you are in his space below. That is why I'm checking if you are on Dingo above.
[7:12 AM]
The 1st goblin is in range... You firing a walloping arrow at him?

Mending
transmutation cantrip. (Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 minute
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (two lodestones)
Duration: Instantaneous
Description
This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can't restore magic to such an object.

You fire a bolt at the goblin, hoping to knock him off the edge, but as it hits he prepares for the force, bracing himself avaoiding being knocked prone...

He does not take any damage as a walloping arrow does not do damage, it only has the chance of knocking an enemy prone.

Tova would like to cast sacred flame on one of the goblins coming towards her and then. Take out her Warhammer and ready herself for the battle.

Yes, following the signal from the goblin (blowing his horn) you can expect that the goblins will start to respond to that call...

Keep in mind that you have Dingo / Piper and then Tova beyond that infront of you. You can fire at the goblins, but the goblins do get a +2 bonus due to partial cover because of the people infront of you.

@Setto Kaiba Is Tiny ably to get in to melee range of any of the goblins?

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:54 AM
Dumbledick, you fire a bolt at the goblin, hitting it in the side... For the next round it will not be able to roll the boulder due to the arrow stuck in its side.

Arden, yoy manage to stay inconspicuous as a goat  

Tiny will not be able to get into melee range due to the party member in front.

Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:16 AM
The goblins will continue moving forward while the one on the ledge above will tend to the bolt lodged in his side. While not able to reach Tova, they will draw their scimitars in attempt to attack on the next turn.

That will bring up Tova...

Ky — Today at 12:26 PM
Tova will step as close to the wall on the ledge as possible, hugging it essentially, hoping to be able to cast gust of wind at as much of an angle as possible to try push them off the ledge. 

I hope you understand what I am trying to achieve here 
[12:27 PM]
It's a strength 12 save please

Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:41 PM
Cool... so you plant your feet firmly on the ground and cast Gust of Wind causing a gust of wind to shoot from you in the direction of the goblins approaching. 

They only have to save once their turn starts so I will roll that on their turn...

Are you moving while doing this or staying in place?

Gust of Wind
2nd-level evocation. (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Tempest Domain, The Fathomless, The Genie)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S, M (a legume seed)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description
A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you.

The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them.

As a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from you.
Spell | BR 248

Ky — Today at 12:46 PM
I will move forward forcing the wind with me and trying to hopefully get passed underneath the goblin with the other boulder as he seems to be down at the moment. Hopefully we can move past before he gets bck to the boulder

Setto Kaiba — Today at 12:51 PM
You move along the ledge slowly and hugging the wall as much a possible using the gust to try and push the goblins off the edge. You get to about 10ft from the goblin with the boulder above with the other 2 goblins on the ledge now just 20ft and 25ft from you respectively.

You would have managed to get to the top of the ledge above... behind you is half a boulder   with a goblin alive but pinned underneath. Infront of you another 40ft away is the 2nd boulder with the goblin trying to recover and gather himself to use the boulder.
[2:04 PM]
Piper using her firebolt launches an attack at the goblin, but the gust of wind created by Tova makes hitting the goblin very hard as it blasts the flames to the side missing the goblin (this is only flavour, these spells do not mechanically affect each other).

Setto Kaiba — Today at 2:08 PM
Since all the other players are behind Tova and Dingo / Piper and it is difficult to really take an action at this point, I will suggest that you are open to pick the order in which you want to act.
