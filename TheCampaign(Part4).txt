Tova Truestorm casts Guiding Bolt!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (17) + 4 = 21
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target until then.

Tova Truestorm casts Spiritual Weapon!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (20) + 4 = 24
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

The weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect resemble that weapon.

So you hit him with your spiritual weapon... but narrowly miss with your guiding bolt as it just shoots wide.

This brings Arden up... @Deformiter (Arden)  are you up and going again?

Nero Ebérloch casts Fire Bolt!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (13) + 4 = 17
Damage: 1d10 (1) = 1
Effect
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

The rest of you see Nero being dragged underwater, in a frenzy of crocodile and blood. The darkness, mist, blood and splashing water makes it hard to see what is happening as Nero is dragged away...

Dumbledick ignores Pipers who ignored his Message spell and didn't whisper back and instead heads straight for the the 4-inches taller than him metal machine and marvel's at it's fine craftsmanship by looking it up and down, sideways and every way possible. 

"Sweet mother of Mordain" (the primary deity of the dwarves & Forge Domain clerics and by default, Dumbledick's deity as he is part Forge Domain Cleric in addition to being a sorcerer). "Not since my military days when I took a trip to a very wealthy and powerful arms manufacturer for some training have I observed such magnificence. Did you make this uh... Apologies, what is your name?"
Dumbledick asks as his annoyance from her lack of a response to his Message spell leaves his mind in place of excitement

Her head tweeks at Enyawds comment and she then climbs up to Dingos head and lays her palm on it. Using Dingo as a vessel she quietly channels her voice through it. "My pops help me create Dingo when I was a wee one we worked on him for years" .....she pauses..." he's not a simple suit of Armour.....he's sentient and exists to protect and defend me on my adventure to become a greater inventor than even the old man himself.... Her hand drops....whispers to herselfI won't let you down pops.

Now what was it you were on about?....
Toombz

Yesterday at 1:04 PM
Now that he knows that she's not using the Message spell and is simply speaking telepathically, he communicates back saying "Why didn't you just respond and chose instead to simply ignore? I don't know where you are from, but it is considered rude in these parts to not reply when asked a question. For my part, I apologise as I did not know the palm was your attempt at greeting. It seemed as though you were attempting to shut me up and stop me from examining the fine creation you have there. I guess you ignoring my questions and me ignoring your palm gesture makes us even"

Dumbledick says as he approaches the campfire and begins eating some of Nero's delicious biltong for breakfast and offers some too saying "as we eat this, let us remember our fallen friend Nero, a fine chef and a brave warrior though I initially though of him as cowardly. May his soul rest well and find peace. What a great lad he was" 
He also telepathically offers the new adventurer some biltong and says "try it. most delicious snack you've ever had"

We are a quiet folk who prefer to communicate in this manner and being known for our creations as to uphold our refined craftsmanship mysteries. Forgive me if I apposed on your customs.

She nervously takes a piece and waddles over to dingo who lifts her up. She tears off a small piece and inserts it into dingos mouth for analysis. Hmm amphibian? She asks? Interesting.....doesn't seem to harbor any bacteria or poison so it should be safe. She then gives it a sniff and a small nibble.

She finishes her ration and then tells dumble" dingo and I will rest in the tree line as to not startle the others when they wake". She picks up 2 pepples off the ground thinkers with them a bit and then taps on it a few times before it starts glowing. She tosses one sending stone towards dumble. "Here use this to give me a ring when yah ready for my grand reveal"

As the rest of our group awakens, Dumbledick uses the sending stone to awaken the new adventurer. He tells the group "We have a new baby Tova with the greatest piece of machinery I have ever seen. A marvel to behold. They are both not hostile but she is not from around here. She may ignore your words because where she's from, actions speak louder than words. So fist bumps and high fives are her communication". Then he offers them some biltong in Nero's memory

Tiny sees the halfling and the metal construct and happily waves and shouts "Hello friends!, Wait was that you in my head just now? That was weird." Tiny then walks up to the metal construct as Enyawd mentions it should fit Tiny, he takes out his saucepan and gently taps the side of the construct Clang Clang then chuckles "Man that sounds so cool, I wish I had one of these." Tiny then turns to the halfling "Hello friend"

"What's your name friend? I'm Tiny, I like your... thing" pointing at the construct 
Turtlebaff420

Yesterday at 4:56 PM
Piper places her hand in tinys giant hand. Apon making contact she links with her mind with Tiny. "Greetings big fella....pardon the intrusion my kind greet this way. It is a way of showing each other trust. This here is my good mate Dingo my pops and I built him when I was a wee one to keep me company on my travels and he's been my protector ever since."

Ae'lun who's pretty much kneeling at this point looks confusedly at the little one he did not notice before. his bow is still in his hand but its basically just hanging there with a very loose grip. "hello..." he timidly holds out his hand in response
Turtlebaff420

Yesterday at 5:28 PM
Piper places her hand in her palm " g'day names piper....sorry to hear about your friend." She keeps glancing at Ae'luns bow. She pauses mid conversation and points at it. " you mind if i fix? She gestures to the bow for him to allow her to look at it.

Yesterday at 5:37 PM
"He..." Ae'lun pauses "He was a good man, a brave man" his stare drifting off into the distance for a second... Snapping back to reality when Piper mentions his bow "fix? Is it broken?" He considers for a second then curiously hands it over
Turtlebaff420
 — 
Yesterday at 5:50 PM
(Pending DM @Setto Kaiba s approval.)"Yes yes fix I fix." She graciously takes the oversized bow and hoists it above her head and waddles over to the nearest rock. She takes out her tinkering tools and begins tightening and tweaking....magical like sparks begin to resonate from it and elven like runes being to glow  ingraved along its length. 

She pulls back the string to test it then smiles as she marvels at her handy work....she waddles back over to Ae'lun and hands him back the bow. She looks him in the eye and almost as if she were seeing through his eyes looking  at the bow he hears her voice resonate in his head once again.... "There fixed....I present the repeating "Neo" bow(name pending). 

side note (NB requires 1 hr of attunement by @Basically_A_Chicken ) It is permanently now infused with the repeating shot infusion:

 This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it when it’s used to make a ranged attack, and it ignores the loading property if it has it.

If the weapon lacks ammunition, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when the wielder makes a ranged attack with it. The ammunition created by the weapon vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

Piper speaks to Ae'lun telepathically. " Aye no problem bud I sensed the pain in your eyes earlier and thought bringing you a keepsake to remind you of your friend so a part of him will forever be with you."

﻿Arden takes out and map and after some careful consideration and speaking to Peridot he agrees that the path to the left seems like a better and more reliable route up and out of the swamp.

Moving on, you spend the good part of the day moving through the swamp and as the swampy terrain starts to change to more rocky hillside and then more mountainous  areas with plants becoming less of an obstacle you can move along faster.

After about 4 hours of traveling you finally reach a good vantage point overlooking most of the swamp and to the other end you see the mountain that is marked on the map.

It is hard to tell feom this distance, but there appears to be some movement upon the hill and close to the marked area.

In between you and the marked area is a narrow stretch leading from this side of the mountain along the edge and then through what appears to be a cave and then another narrow ledge leading up in the other side to the cave that you belive is the stronghold of the Grey Skull Goblins.

Standing there, you begin to ponder the scale of the force you might be facing...the terrain itself favors them...

With all this in mind... what is the parties plan of action?

Arden, taking the lead through the treacherous terrain towards the stronghold of the Grey Skull Goblins, remains vigilant, his senses attuned to the natural world around him and the subtle shifts in the environment. He pauses, his keen eyes scanning the narrow stretch that lies ahead, contemplating the challenges of navigating through the cave and across the precarious ledge. "Peridot," Arden calls softly, ensuring his voice carries only to those closest to him. "The path ahead demands our utmost caution. Let us employ our skills to ascertain the safest route." With a focused mind, he suggests they perform a combined effort: Arden offers to use his enhanced perceptiveness to reveal safer paths, while seeking Peridot's keen insights. "Together, we can ensure the safety of our companions and navigate with precision." Arden stands ready, his resolve as unwavering as the ancient trees of the forest.
Setto Kaiba
 — 
Today at 9:07 AM
There aren't any tall trees in this area... plants here are dry grasslands and the trees are scarce. 

To get a better view of the force you might be facing you could try and scout from here. You could continue on along the narrow path, through the cave (tunnel if you will) and out the other side to get closer.

All these options do have the possibility of the goblins being able to spot you. They might have scouts or a watch.
Setto Kaiba

Today at 9:09 AM
From here there does not seem to be a better way of moving forward than along the narrow path, though this might change once you reach the cave / tunnel.
Deformiter (Arden)
 — 
Today at 9:10 AM
Gazing across the rugged terrain that lay before them, Arden turns to his Dwarven comrades. "Friends, the mountains ahead hold secrets known perhaps only to those familiar with their embrace. Do any among you, versed in the lore of the mountains, feel called to guide our steps?" His request, a testament to his trust in their collective wisdom and strength, invites his companions to lead, acknowledging the depth of knowledge and experience that only those connected to the mountain's heart possess.
Toombz

Seems like we have no other choice than the cave or tunnel but maybe the more stealthy players should go first? I have the Message cantrip that stretches to 120ft so you don't have to worry about the noise from my armour and if necessary I can extend it to 240ft.. That's just my suggestion @everyone
Toombz
 — 
Today at 9:48 AM
I will be right behind them around 120ft or so.. And when I speak the Message Spell into your mind, you'll respond in a silent whisper only I can hear so you'll maintain your stealth 
Turtlebaff420
 — 
Today at 9:57 AM
Not sure what good the message cantrip will do they will have the elevation so they could spot us before we even make it 240ft. If someone has pass without trace or invisibility that would be a better fit

So... You are basically on the side of the mountain looking to towards the Goblin Cave on the side of the next mountain about 2 to 2.5 miles away. To get there you must travel along a narrow pathway running alongside the mountain you are on and to a tunnel or cave that is about 700ft to 900ft away and then potentially on the other side of this cave or tunnel is a narrow path leading up and and the Goblin Cave.

Peridot, you start to walk off in the direction of the narrow ledge leading towards the tunnel. As you make your way down slowly and carefully, making sure to step quietly and not be seen you come about 1/4 of the way to where you can see the tunnel entrance when you hear something... movement... you stop and look around trying to find a way to avoid detection when you feel something grabbing you and pulling you behind a little patch of vines hanging from the rock face. As the figure grabs you it tella you to be quiet as you hear footsteps just a few feet beyond, around the bend.

Okay I could do two things but Peridot knowing they going towards his party will follow the goblins untill he is about 90ft from the party and then dash past to warm them. ( I can move 135ft in a round if I move dash and step of the wind)

Deformiter (Arden)

Yesterday at 5:56 PM
Arden, amidst the unfolding events and the palpable tension as Peridot ventured into the unknown, found a moment of solitude to reconnect with the natural world around him. Drawing from the essence of Zivara's teachings on the interconnectedness of all life, he quietly observes the play of shadows and light across the rugged terrain, seeking wisdom in the silent dance of nature. With a deep breath, he focuses on the subtle energies of the earth beneath his feet, feeling the ancient strength of the mountains and the resilient spirit of the plants that dared to grow in such a stark landscape. In this moment of communion with the earth, Arden seeks not only to understand the messages of the natural world but also to impart his own energies in a silent offering of gratitude and respect. As he stands there, the boundaries between himself and the land blurred, reminding him that even in times of uncertainty, there is a profound unity and purpose to be found in the embrace of the natural world.

Andil wouldn't follow Peridot as she is pretty sure she'd fall off the edge of the narrow ledge (or get stepped on if she wildshaped into a mouse or something similar.) She would try to keep following the goblins from a safe distance.

Dumbledick, while remaining completely still, is repeatedly casting the Message cantrip at its normal range of 120 ft with the target being Peridot as I suggested earlier. He whispers the spell's words softly every time while also keeping his ears open for any incoming footsteps or sounds not originating from the group.

Dumbledick will repeatedly be asking Peridot with his Message cantrip: "Peridot, it's Dumbledick here. Were you spotted and are now running back?

As you emerge from the vines and follow the goblins, staying 40ft behind them... You move for about 150ft before you see as one of them stops and says to the other in goblin "Stop... I hear something moving" and then turns around seeing Peridot and possibly Andil behind him.

What would you like to do?

@Enyawd Nightbeard are you gonna tell the group about this? Because once you do, Dumbledick is gonna make a suggestion that involves Pass Without Trace, Arden & Enyawd while the "shiny mirror" Dumbledick, Tova & Tinman wait for both Peridot & this second explorer group come back with intel. But of course, there are other options like all of us staying put, or some deciding to check up on Peridot since we may be getting anxious/worried. Just opening the door for discussion & of course the first part of this message involves Enyawd officially telling the group what he sees😂

You can see the ledge that you all will have to take to get to the tunnel it snakes around the edge of the mountain slighly down and then you go through the tunnel and then up again with a similar ledge on the other side... the ledge is about 2ft wide.
DM advice... It might be a good idea to plan here what you are gonna do as you find yourself close to what your characters believe to be the hideout of 100 or more grey skull goblins.

Arden, gazing at the narrow ledge stretching ahead, understands the precariousness of their path. The surefootedness required to traverse such terrain sparks an idea within him. In a moment of quiet resolve, he chooses to embrace the form most suited for this challenge. With the party's eyes away from him, he seamlessly transitions, his form reshaping into that of a goat. Renowned for their impeccable agility and unerring balance on the most treacherous mountain paths, his goat form offers the perfect embodiment of stability and confidence needed for the journey ahead. Transformed, Arden bleats, as if to gain the attention of his party and take the lead, he nods his head in the direction of the ledge, he moves forward and sets a steady pace for his companions to follow should they decide to.

Dumbledick, because of his noisy armor, would stay in position because he doesn't wanna compromise their position. Also, because he knows this is a Goblin stronghold, he will be weary that there could be hundreds of them so unless theres a way to stealthily enter the cave, he won't wanna take any chances until there is certainty. If he sees a ton of goblins coming, he will do what he did when he saw dozens of crocodiles and that is run. If Peridot cries out for help, he will go help first before retreating but he will hope Peridot will coming running back at the first sign of trouble (50 goblins coming at him😂 ). That's currently his state of mind.

Meanwhile...

With the goblin up first, he will loosen a flask of oil from around his belt and throw it onto the ground infront of him... 10ft away, covering 5ft in some sort of oil.

Using his movement he will duck down... effectively being prone for mechanical terms, ending his turn. The terrain is now slippery and will require a Dex Check to pass over without slipping.

The second Goblin will mutter a few words, using his bonus action to cast a spell... and draw an arrow from his quiver, instantly lightning the tip as he draws this arrow. With the Goblin infront of him prone he is able to get a shot towards the oil and will attempt to light the oil with his arrow...

With Arden and Enyawd leading... coming around you will now be able to see this, although not clearly but you will be able to make out that Peridot is engaged with two goblins and a giant spider.
Everyone is obviously single file as you are making your way towards them on this ledge.

Arden leading as the goat, Enyawd behind him.

Wait... Arden is the goat? 🤣 This whole time I'm thinking Enyawd was just following some random goat.

Enyawd, still a bit pissed with goblins and the curse goblinsbane, will ready his bow to shoot at the nearest goblin on his turn... [rolls coming in case i'm afk]

Dumbledick would be first behind Arden and Enyawd cause he needed to be to cast the Message cantrip as effectively as possible at 120 ft

Missing on both attacks as Peridot is able to parry the attacks using his quarterstaff.
The 2nd goblin will will use his long bow to shoot at the spider now on the wall next to Peridot. He will attack twice and use his attacker ability adding 2 to his attack and damage rolls.

As Andil reverts back to human form, she falls onto the ledge. Peridot manages to get out of the way, but Andil isn't able to hold on and is now dangling from the edge, barely hanging on... her hands slipping.

Since Andil fell, the goblin will not be able to take his 2nd shot, but now Peridot has to make a choice... attack the goblin, or attempt to save his new comrade 🤔
