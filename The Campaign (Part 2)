no problem, you'll always have ±12 hours to have your turn and if you miss it, the game will continue till you come back (from my understanding 🙂 )

@Setto Kaiba, @Turtlebaff420 is in another dnd game tonight. Will only be able to respond later
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Cool... What is the party's plan?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Im also wondering
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:17 PM
Peridot will walk to the stairs stealthy to try and get a view of what could lay below.
this wouldve happened before the smashing of boxes but if we past that then its okay
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:20 PM
Going with a torch?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:21 PM
noooo bad idea
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 9:24 PM
Heading down the stairs into the room below... you wouldn't be able to see much more of the room than you previously did as it is quite dark, especially since the pit is 100ft deep (that you know of)
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:26 PM
or ill take a caltrop and ask tova to cast light on it and throw it down the stairs but have it covered in my robes till i get to the stairs
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:32 PM
Arden follows closely behind Peridot, melding into the shadows with practiced ease. Leveraging his darkvision and his connection to nature, he scans for roots that might betray the presence of nearby threats. His hands lightly brush against the stone walls and grab hold of the nearest root he can find, sensing for the subtlest disturbances that could indicate danger.
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:33 PM
or that I too have darkvision
Ky — Yesterday at 9:35 PM
Are you guys moving back towards the room with the pit and the goblins we left behind?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
Yea to the stairs we got attacked after the spears
Burger — Yesterday at 9:36 PM
I have dark vision, I see up to 60 feet in the dark but in grays and blacks
What does the room look like?
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 9:41 PM
I'll put out my lantern, with Shnuggles flying behind me. I'll try my best to follow the group in the dark once again
Ky — Yesterday at 9:43 PM
Tova will suggest that she goes first, as the one in heavy armor, so that she can cast fog cloud (2nd lvl) on the wall with the holes so that hopefully the goblins can't see us move past and even if they hear us, attacks should be at disadvantage. We won't be able to explore but maybe move passed and see what is next... Though that does have it's own risks. We could run into an ambush considering they know we are there and have had time to figure out their own plan of action
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
Arden heard Tova and nods his head in agreement, moving out of the way to let her past him.
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:44 PM
"Just a quick scout ahead I can get out real quick, in and out just to get some intel"
Burger — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
Do when know what is in the pit?
We*
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:48 PM
Arden looks around and waits for the rest of the group to decide what they want to do, he's perfectly comfortable hidden with his Mask of the Wild
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:50 PM
We were just right now between the door and those black boxes. Now we are attempting to go right, toward the "mostly unknown" area, which is the pit, there's a thin ledge on either side of the pit. Where those dashed lines are, there were holes in the walls, where goblins attacked us with poison spears.

This was the map Ae'lun drew with a stick on the floor 😄
Burger — Yesterday at 9:52 PM
Dumb idea but can't we like use the pelt of the big boars  as a disguise and scare the goblins away? 😂
Burger — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
Patty gives Ae'lun a pat on the back 😂
Jarrod — Yesterday at 9:53 PM
'Psst Arden lets go scout' Peridot will say to Arden just wanting to grab intel. PS this is a whisper
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 9:56 PM
Arden, whispers in agreement, noting that the rest of the party seems to be keen to hang back for a bit, we need some more information, our party will make a lot of noise unintentionally and we could risk falling into another trap
Ky — Yesterday at 9:58 PM
Wait, the fog cloud is a sphere which means we will have to walk through it too. But if I cast it on one side of the pit to obscure the vision of the goblins that would be 'shooting' arrows at us, and then we crawl along the other edge so we are under the hole height, we could get across but we still don't know what is on the other side
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:00 PM
Arden decides to meditate on it and see if Zivara might have some answers.
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:01 PM
Sorry everyone what did I miss....170+ messages😂
Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:07 PM
Quick catchup boards dead arden and peridot gonna sneak to grab intel
Down the stairs
The rest of party will follow behind a couple of feat
Boars*
Basically_A_Chicken — Yesterday at 10:08 PM
could I send Shnuggles ahead with Arden and Peridot to check things out?
or would you rather he hang back?
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
Nero obviously took what he could from the boars as they make some of the tastiest biltong in all the planes
He would also like to cast blade ward on his shell again @Setto Kaiba
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:18 PM
Is he stealthy? or will he be flap flap flapping? 😄
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:21 PM
Sure... after killing the boars 🐗 you spend the next hour while Nero skins and cuts up the boar and Patty helps to construct a door... 

Patty, please just roll a d100 for me... this will determine how good the door is... 🤔

Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:27 PM

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:27 PM
In the dark?
Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:27 PM
i believe so
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:27 PM
Arden would like to use his druidic abilities (and "Keen Senses"), feeling the earth around them, taking hold of some roots and using the interconnectedness of nature to find nearby enemies. 
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:29 PM
You see the same thing you saw earlier... nothing in the dark... even with dark vision you only see outlines, grey and black outlines ofbthe rocks and the water below...
Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:30 PM

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:46 PM
You make it all the way to end.... turn left and make it to the hallway on the other end of the pit...when you hear this scratching sound and looking back you see this dwarf clumsily trying to crawl closer 😂

Arden and Peridot, reaching the other side you see infront of you a 30ft hallway about 10ft wide and 60ft high...
Jarrod — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
Looking back "Shh be careful, maybe wait here for a sec. Arden lets go"
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 10:48 PM
Nero would like to follow suit
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:48 PM
Arden follows behind Peridot, still as stealthfully as he can, he looks around to see if there's anything in the hallway, especially along the walls.
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 10:49 PM
as you follow please give me a stealth check...
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 10:49 PM

Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:06 PM
Peridot and Arden... looking into the room, you see...

6 sarcophagai 3 to your left and 3 to your right... in the middle of the room is an altar made of marble and at the back is a huge tree recessed into the wall and growing through to what you assume must be the surface. At the bottom of this tree you see a wooden chest... large 1m by 1m by 1m almost and 2 wooden desks standing on the left side between the sarcophagai and the altar...

And that is where I will leave the game tonight... 
Setto Kaiba — Yesterday at 11:07 PM
Standing up and walking... you can make it all the way to Peridot who is currently still on the floor 😂
Turtlebaff420 — Yesterday at 11:08 PM
Can I catch up to the others?

Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:10 PM
Well there was only no danger cos we stealthed here....
with no light....
Burger — Yesterday at 11:11 PM
I have dark vision so do I need to do a stealth check when I need to move?
Deformiter (Arden) — Yesterday at 11:12 PM
These sarcophagai are giving Arden the creeps, he's almost certain there's going to be some undead that jump out.... Their existence challenge the harmony Zivara seeks, representing a disruption to the natural order and balance.
Enyawd Nightbeard — Today at 8:02 AM
Enyawd glares into the room ahead, blinking his eyes. He is alert, scanning for goblins and other threats - ready to permanently undead any undead. He is really tempted to go searching through these sarcophagi
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 8:23 AM
"Oi nature boy dont you still have dem magic stones? We can flick one in to see if it triggers the sarcophagai/ potential traps? Perhaps even draw out a potential ambush? What say you?" 
Burger — Today at 11:36 AM
"Psst, hay Nero do you think we should pursue after Arden and Peridot, maybe there are enemy's or an ambush"
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:43 AM
Jip... so dark vision helps you to see in the dark, but it's not like night vision, it just makes seeing slightly easier. So in total darkness you can see slightly better and in low light you can see as normal.

Your stealth check would determine how well you can move in the area without making a sound or leaving a trace of your movement.
Burger — Today at 11:44 AM
so what do I need to do to go where peridot is
Turtlebaff420 — Today at 11:45 AM
I already did my stealth check and made it to Arden and peridot right dm? 
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:46 AM
You can make a Stealth Check to see how stealthily you can make your way over there.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:47 AM
Jip... Making your way over there you got the feeling that you might have made some noise,  but nothing jumped out or attacked you while you moved in that direction.
Setto Kaiba — Today at 11:48 AM
His spell is only active for 1min ( I believe)... so he would have to cast it again if you wanted to use it.

Deformiter (Arden)
Magic Stone
transmutation cantrip. (Artificer, Druid, Warlock)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 bonus action
Range: Touch
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 minute
Description
You touch one to three pebbles and imbue them with magic. You or someone else can make a ranged spell attack with one of the pebbles by throwing it or hurling it with a sling. If thrown, it has a range of 60 feet. If someone else attacks with the pebble, that attacker adds your spellcasting ability modifier, not the attacker's, to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Hit or miss, the spell then ends on the stone.

If you cast this spell again, the spell ends early on any pebbles still affected by it.
Spell | EE 160
