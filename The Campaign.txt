What is Play by Post?

Play by Post is a style of play where all interaction in the game is done via post (text chat).  Just as in normal D&D, the DM sets the scene and players gets to respond to this with their character‚Äôs actions. The DM might ask the player to do some checks based on their character‚Äôs skills and will resolve the actions accordingly.

Players can join the game at any time, provided they have a character (in dndbeyond) of the appropriate level. Since this is text based, and we are not all as fortunate to have plenty of free time, Play by Post is a much slower way to engage with the game. When the DM sets the scene, players will be able to respond and based on those responses the scene will move forward. This might mean that your character could be dragged into a scenario due to other players responding more frequently. If a scenario directly affects a certain player, that player will have 12hours to respond to the scenario or the scene will automatically move forward. This will also apply to combat, where a character‚Äôs turn will be skipped after 12hours of inactivity. 

Most Play by Post games are long campaigns that could span years due to the slow nature of the posts, however we will use a ‚ÄúScene‚Äù or ‚ÄúScenario‚Äù based playstyle where the DM will post a scene or a scenario and the players will get to react with until that scenario has been resolved. Players may engage with some scenarios and skip others as they choose ‚Äì the only requirements will be to adjust your chosen character for that scenario. 

Most play by post games die out due to players not being able to post for long periods (coz life), should life get in the way, please let the other participants know just to ensure we are all on the same page and join a later game if you like.
To link your character to the game, we will make use of the Avrae bot which integrates dndbeyond with Discord. To make this easier for the more casual players, we will not use the full capacity of the bot, yet only use a few commands. To add your character, follow the instructions below‚Ä¶

Once you‚Äôre done making your character, make sure it‚Äôs publicly viewable (Avrae needs to be able to see your sheet), grab the sharing URL, and follow the steps below depending on what sheet system you chose to use. You should see your character‚Äôs stats pop up in Discord!

To add a character from D&D Beyond, use the following command:

üêâ Scenario 1... Lv. 3 Character üëª


The Grey Skull Forest, a small forest in the west, known for it's  vibrant fauna and flora, draws many scholars, druids and nature enthusiasts. Though in the last few years, a tribe of Goblins (the grey skull tribe) has declared this their territory, using gorilla warfare methods in attacking travelers and scholars alike. There has been a few attempts from locals to repel the Goblins, however the tribe appears to be smart, avoiding larger groups of soldiers and ambusing others. Due to it's small size, King Grodan has not seen the need to launch a full invasion, yet for the local villagers and smaller groups of travelers this remains a big threat.

Having heard of this, you are making your way to Windcrest just north of the Grey Skull forest. Passing through a small part of the forest you see a cabin... the cabin is well built, made from strong stone and a good timber finish. Outside you see smoke rising from the chimney as the plesent smell of a rabbit stew draws you in.

Standing outside this cabin, what do you do?
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 11:48 AM
Do I see any windows that we can peak through?
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 12:27 PM
Are there any foot prints leading to the cabin? And if so, can we tell if they are human/goblin?
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 12:38 PM
Image
The wooden door is closed, Peridot you notice 1 window on the fron side, may be more at the back... you could walk up to it and peek in. As you do you hear movement behid you, the clanking of armour.

Tova, follwoing some foorprints outside, as you walk up you see... What does Peridot look like?
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 12:59 PM
You see a tall Human monk in blue robes with short blonde hair and a quaterstaff in his hand 
Image
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 1:33 PM
Tova will greet Peridot... From a distance with her Warhammer at the ready... Well met good sir
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 1:35 PM
In shock Peridot turns around startled by the Dwarf behind him that he did not notice. "G.. Good day to you, I am Peridot"
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 1:54 PM
What Peridot will see when he looks at Tova is a small, even by Dwarf standards, stocky female dwarf with flaming red hair. Her Warhammer is almost as big as her. It looks a little unsettling in her small hands. Her face is hard set and she looks like she is suspicious of the world... Because she is.

Do you live here? She will ask again. She will not offer her name at this time.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:00 PM
Now standing tall. 

Peridot responds: This is not my place no, I heard of Goblins in the area torturing the people here and I only recently came across this here cabin which I was busy trying to look for any goblins on the inside
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:15 PM
I too am looking for the Goblins, which has lead me here. I did not want to barge in if it was your home. I will look around the back then, shall I?
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:19 PM
Please go ahead and shout if you encounter something
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:32 PM
Peridot, walking up to the front window you peek through the glass. Inside you see a well furnished dining area, and beyond that the kitchen, the walls covered with a mixture of herbs and a table with a recent kill, a partly carved boar.

Warrick, walking around to the other side you see 2 windows, 1 will be located directly accross the window Peridot is looking through and the other will look to a bedroom, looking in through this window you will see a well arranged yet simplistic bedroom, bed, desk, cupboard, trunk, rug... nothing seems out of the ordinary.
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:38 PM
Tova will go back around to Peridot and tell him what she saw. She will also note that the place looks a bit to well arranged, to clean to belong to goblins... From what she has heard. There may be another person around
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:44 PM
Looking around through the window can anyone be seen on the inside?
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 2:50 PM
You do not see anyone through the window... Unless someone is purposefully hiding in the house you do not get the feeling that someone is inside.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 3:05 PM
I convey this, adding : It feels wrong just breaking in when no one is around
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 3:19 PM
Are there any foot steps leading away from the cabin? Or trees where Tova could maybe sit and watch but be hidden from sight?
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 3:42 PM
If you are looking specifically for tracks, give me a Survival check. Otherwise if you are looking to see some trees, yes you can definitely find a couple of trees and bushes to hide in. To climb the tree I will need you to make an Acrobatics check and then a Stealth check or just a Stealth check if you want to hide in a bush.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 3:42 PM
I shall climb into a tree and hide

Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 3:46 PM
we are so good at this
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 3:59 PM
Tova - With a 14 on your survival check you can definitly tell that there are human track around the cabin leading both in and out and some smaller animal tracks around. You don't see any Goblin tracks here. After looking at the tracks you look for a good dense bush and clumsily crouch down and hide between the shrubs.

Peridot, as a monk, you are quite agile and used to climbing and move smoothly into a nice perched position... though you feel that your blue robes do not really blend well with the environment.

How long would you like to wait there?
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:02 PM
Untill the dwarf(whos name peridot doesnt know)  gives the clear
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:07 PM
Tova will sit a 30 or 40 minutes, eating something and waiting to see if the house owner comes back. Maybe they know something about the goblins.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:13 PM
With Peridot sitting in the tree and Tova in the bush (eating...on her own, not sharing) you sit there for 30 or 40 min, nothing happens. Every now and then you see a rabbit  hop past or a spider crawl by, but otherwise nothing... it's all quiet.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:14 PM
With Peridot in the tree can he have a look around at a bit of a height level to see if he can see any Goblins or humanoid creatures
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:24 PM
The forest around you is quite thick and it is difficult to really see much, but give me a Perception check as you are trying to see or hear anything around you.

Tova's snacking and the good smells coming from the cabin makes it hard to really focus. You know however that the town of Windcrest is just about 1 hours walk away.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:37 PM
Peridot will jump down the tree walk over to Tova and tell her the town we looking for is about an hours walk away and I could not spot anything from the tree
I also ask if she wants to join me in travelling there as it could be safer to travel together
Ky ‚Äî 01/12/2024 4:41 PM
Tova, getting bored sitting around will get up to follow but stop and staring longingly at the house, sniffing the air. She's very tempted to pull a goldilocks. She will fall in besides Peridot and say 'names Tova by the way... Tova Truestorm
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/12/2024 5:12 PM
Peridot also temped by the smells of the food but refocusing welcomes Tova and at a slow and steady march not making too much noise travelling to the town we set out to go to

The town of Windcrest is located at the foot of a mountain range and defended by a wooden barricade wall with 2 guard towers at the main gate. If you were to come over the mountain range you would see a town with a natural river running from the mountain range meandering through the different parts of the town, dividing the more "industrial" side from the "residential" area. At the base of the mountain is Windcrest Lake with the Town Hall built on an island in the lake.

As Peridot and Tova approaches the gate, you see an Air Genasi standing outside speaking to the guards atop the tower.

What does Ae'lun look like?
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:17 AM
He's young and relatively short, dressed in simple leather armor. His long pale blue hair is tied in a top knot to keep it out of his face, one of his blue eyes is completely greyed over.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:35 AM
Looking up to the man on the tower, a young man, tall with short brown hair and a bow by his side stands and says "state your name and business!"
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 12:13 PM
Ae'lun laughs nervously, The name's Ae'lun. I don't really have particular business here, quite the opposite in truth. I've been out in the wilds and have run out of both supplies and the means to procure them
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 3:41 PM
Tova will step up from behind the air Genassi and say, 'we heard this here town is having some issues with goblins. We have come to help. Where might we find more information on this situation?'
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 3:55 PM
Peridot will follow suit just standing next to Tova as she does the talking
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 4:42 PM
"You've run out of supplies... what and now you think you're gonna come beg on the streets here in our town do you? We don't want no beggers... and you Dwarf and you with the blue robes, are you a priest... are you friends with this begger?
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 4:54 PM
"I'm no begger! Sure I may be a bit down on my luck at the moment... Although it sounds like that's about to change. You've got a goblin problem and I've got some arrows, If you can afford them"
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:18 PM
‚ÄúI am no priest, I am a monk. No one i know.‚Äù Peridot says to the guard. ‚ÄúHowever, we will take all the help we can‚Äù he says to Ae‚Äôlun
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:23 PM
"Sure, we can be friends... if he would like to help us slay goblins, as my travel companion has said, we will take all the help we can get"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:29 PM
"The three of you are gonna solve our goblin problem? Eric, you hear that, a priest, a dwarf and a air bender is gonna solve our goblin problem... hahahaha! It's a bit late to go see Gregory, but you can try and negotiate some rooms at the Waving Branch Inn... Open the gate" The gate opens and you can make your way in.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:31 PM
Peridot wispers to Tova ‚ÄúQuite rude guards, lets get to the inn settle down for the night and go see this Gregory in the morning ‚Äú and heads in to try and find the inn
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:34 PM
Tova will look at the guard and say "well since your city watch doesn't seem able to keep the people safe, I guess we have to" and she will walk with Peridot and invite Ae'lun to join if he wishes
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:41 PM
Ae'lun smiles "If you'll have a lowly 'beggar' as myseIf would be honoured to lend you my bow for the time being"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:41 PM
It's because of us that this here town is safe, I'll have you know... he shouts as you walk off.

As you walk in, about 5m or so, a young boy, human, walks up to you... by his clothing you can see he is not rich, but had put some effort into his appearance, hair well maintained, little bit of a beard starting. "You look to be new in town, you looking to stay at the Inn?"
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 5:45 PM
Tova will mutter "Sure, sure" under her breathe, answering the guards shouts and then introduce herself and Peridot to Ae'lun.

Yes, please show us the way. She will also ask the boy if he knows a Gregory and where we might find him.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 6:03 PM
Ae'lun tags along "thanks for the help back there, I get the feeling they weren't going to let me in"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 6:48 PM
Great... the Waving Branch it is then! Come right this way! Gregory is the town sheriff, head of the guard. He is usually at the Town Hall, but it is late now so he probably went home, he will be back tomorrow. Where are you all from?
He looks around to see if there are any bags he can take etc.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 7:13 PM

"I'm more of the wandering type myself, you could say im from everywhere." While giving a friendly smile "are you from around these parts?"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 9:00 PM
Peridot, you kinda pat your pockets just to make sure nothing is missing, but everything feels like it is there, no missing items.

"Ah, the mountains he says... I would love to travel there.

A free spirit, yes, what an exciting life. I was born and raised here... Windcrest is my home...lived here my whole life.

The Inn is just ahead, so would you like 1 large room or would you prefer seperate rooms... we have a large room for groups that's a bit cheaper and comes with a breakfast option... breakfst is the most important meal of the day" he chuckles a bit and leads you forward.
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 9:02 PM
Tova very quickly says she'd like her own room. She doesn't know these gentleman well enough to share a room
However, she will offer to pay for the night for everyone. She's expecting a payday once the goblins have been slain
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 9:25 PM
"Great! That is 4 silver per room so 12 silver and another 1 silver for breakfast each so 3 silver... plus 12 silver is 15 silver" in total...

She hands it over with some extra for drinks and food for now. She will ask if anyone else wants anything
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 9:44 PM

Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 9:45 PM
Ae'lun rubs the back of his neck "I owe you, man its going to be good to have a bath! Wait there is a bath right?"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 9:58 PM
He takes the money, and puts it into his pocket and leads you to the Inn... From the outside it looks homey, welcoming and delightful. Softwood and softwooden tree trunks make up most of the building's outer structure.
It's impossible to see through the windows, but the enjoyment from within can be felt outside. He opens the door and says "now I leave you in the capable hands of the innkeep."... He turns to Ae'lun... "yes   it is shared but yes, you can most certainly have a nice long bath." He turns and walks off.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 10:01 PM
Peridot will tell Ae'lun and Tova "Please keep an eye on the kid for a sec" and walk over to the innkeep and ask them " Do you know the kid that lead us in? We paid him for your services." 
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 10:10 PM
You walk over to the innkeep, he is a well built man, long grey hair pulled back into a  ponytail, darker skin... a serious man.
Image
"What kid?" At that, the kid now at the end of the building, about 30ft away darts toward the left and in between the bushes behind the inn... "If you paid him for my services, then you just got robbed"

Setto Kaiba
Levitate
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

Your 22 perception beats his 12 stealth... As he darts around the corner trying to hide amongst the shrubs growing around the inn, you follow and easily spots his bright clothing between the dull colour of the shrubs. Casting levitate, he suddenly starts to float, butt upward trying to grab the shrubs. "uh, what's happening...hey, hey, what's going on? Help! Help!

While that is happening, Peridot will talk to the innkeeper "The name is Peridot, here to help with the golbin issue. How much for 3 rooms with breakfast for one night and a few drinks plus a meal for now?" 
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 10:47 PM
Ae'lun casually walks up to the kid "I think I'd like a refund, unless that is you were getting those bushes ready for my bath?"
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 10:53 PM
Tova will sit laughing as the scene unfolds
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:26 PM
The innkeep responds to Peridot "Here to help with the Goblins, well then I guess you will be heading out to see Gregory in the morning. As for the rooms, it's usually 15 silver... but since you are here to help I will let you stay at no charge, for 1 night"

Ae'lun, walking up to the kid, him hanging in the air "uh, I was just...uh, here...here is your money" and he tries to pull out the money that now just falls out his pocket into the bushes.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:34 PM
Peridot being of noble lineage cannot accept that and says ‚ÄúI thank you for the offer but please accept my payment for the rooms and food‚Äù and hands over 20 silver
‚ÄúI assume that‚Äôll be enough for one night and a meal‚Äù
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:38 PM
Ae'lun slowly lets the kid down "no hard feelings, you almost had me with that one, run along now"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:53 PM
The innkeep takes the 20 silver, puts 10 into his pocket and another 10 into a separate bag, hands you a set of 3 keys and says "I shall add this 10 silver to the market for those in need" You and your friends are welcome to have a drink, stuff your bellies and if a fight breaks out, just make sure to keep clear of the furniture. In the morning I shall point you to Gregory.

The kid seems surprised by your kind action and runs off into town, leaving 15 silver.

Peridot will do just that and stuff his face while invining his new companions to his table. Once they arrive he will tell him they can eat as much as they like and rooms are secured for each of us. And hands them their keys
Ky ‚Äî 01/13/2024 11:58 PM
I assume the 15 silver left behind are what Tova originally paid? If so, she will offer the money to the bar keep to add to his 'those in need' bag. And then she will eat and drink Ale
She will thank Peridot for paying and offer to pay the next one since she originally said she would pay
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/14/2024 12:03 AM
Ae'lun sits down and immediately grabs a piece of bread before thanking his companions
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/14/2024 12:06 AM
Unless there is something you would like to do before going to bed, you can all head to your rooms with a belly full of food and ale...and tomorrow perhaps you will be able to meet with Gregory.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/14/2024 10:15 AM
The next morning you are woken up by the sounds and the smells of the inn. People are drinking, talking and outside people are setting up. Tables and shade cloths, fresh fruit and vegetables, mugs for ale and much more are put up creating a market like feel with those in need able to come and get free food and drink...overseen by the Innkeep off course. As you make your way down and out, the Innkeep greats you "all was to your liking I presume?"

While you are talking to the innkeep, you can overhear a group of men standing around a wagon talking amongst themselves. One of the men, a larger fellow with fine looking robes and a long grey beard says "We almost lost our entire load, luckily we hired extra guards to protect the goods this time otherwise we would have lost it all. They only managed a few things, and we only lost 2 men" The men continue to talk amongst themselves about their travels and the goods they sell.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/14/2024 11:14 AM
Peridot not really paying attention to the people outside. Replies ‚ÄúWas a better night rest than I‚Äôve had in a while, can i get something to eat?‚Äù
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/14/2024 11:43 AM
You see a few young boys bringing out a big pot of what appears to be a stew of some sort and they also bring some bread, and nuts and places it on the tables... "You are welcome to anything here. This is both for my patrons and the community, please help yourself. When you are ready, Podrick here will point you in the direction of the Town Hall where you can meet with Gregory. If you are looking for some general supplies you can visit the Silver Leaf (General Store) and you can speak to Yarost, our blacksmith, if you need any weapons or armour... be warned, this is a small town and weapons and armour are expensive as it is hard to come by"
Ky ‚Äî 01/14/2024 11:54 AM
Tova will look longingly at the food but offer to help with the market first. She will chat to the people around, especially those who seem to be in need. She will offer herbs and medicine to those who seem to need it. 

When she hears the group of men speaking by the wagon, she will grab a couple bowls of food and take it over to them, asking if they are ok and what happened
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/14/2024 12:23 PM
Ae'lun walks over to the innkeep "things around here must be pretty grim, for you to do all this. Are the goblins to blame for all of this?"
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/14/2024 6:45 PM
Peridot will sit eat his breakfast and then head his way to the general store waiting there for Tova and Ae'lun. Will tell them he is going that way
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/14/2024 8:49 PM
"OK... are we ok...? We almost had our heads smashed in by the Goblins" one of the merchants replies. "These Goblins have been plaguing our lands for months and yet the king does nothing" he adds. 

Ae'lun... The innkeep looks at the people in the que waiting to get food "most of these come from neighboring villages that were raided, these villages does not have the means to protect themselves and thus the villagers are either killed, taken hostage or driven out. They have nowhere to go and thus end up here. We are short on resources ourselves and had to ahow some of the more competent looking individuals away to other towns"

Peridot, you can make your way over to the general store easily enough with a little help from the locals. There you will be met by an elderly woman, well dressed... and her son asking if they can assist with anything.
Ky ‚Äî 01/14/2024 8:54 PM
Tova will ask, 'what can you tell me of the raid? Do you remember how many goblins there were? Do you have an idea of where they came from?'
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/14/2024 9:01 PM
"There were hundreds of them, they came from everywhere... one moment we were still getting our tents ready and the next thing we knew they were everywhere... The small ones came at us with clubs while the big ones took aome of the goods."
Ky ‚Äî 01/14/2024 9:04 PM
Tova will thank them, offer to treat any wounds they may have and go grab a bowl of food. She's thinking they really need to speak to Gregory because this sounds like a big problem... Maybe bigger than they can handle
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/14/2024 9:29 PM
Ae'luns usual smile fades as he quietly looks at the people in line before thanking the innkeep and heading towards general store
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/14/2024 9:40 PM
Peridot will go in and great the person inside and then asks for if they have any darts available
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 11:50 AM
"You are looking for farts... Why would we have farts"... "Darts mother, darts!" the boy says to his mother. "Excuse my mother, she is partly deaf. If you are looking for darts I do have some, Yarost made these just a few days ago. I almost didn't take them coz I saw no need for them, but luckily I did. I haven't seen you around these parts before, are you going hunting?"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 11:59 AM
He walks over to a wooden box and takes 12 darts out of the box. "Is he looking for darts" the shopkeeper says to her son. "Yes mother, darts... not farts" he replies. "Well why didn't he just say so..." she mutters to herself. "Here we go, I have 12 darts. They sell for 5cp each, but if you take all 12 I will make them 3cp each" he says.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/15/2024 12:38 PM
‚ÄúHere to help with the goblin issue at hand and always usefully to have a few of these around, also do you perhaps have any tiny metal balls ? And I will take all 12 darts‚Äù

"You need golden tissues for what?" the older woman says "no mother, he is here to help with the goblins, you know the ones that had been raiding the towns."

"Oh, the goblins... you know when I was young I heard a story about a tomb just beyond the forest where goblins go to sacrifice children"

As she says that, Tova and Ae'lun walks into the general store followed by two more people... two elves...Please tell us what your characters look like.
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:10 PM
Bronwyn is very short and small for a half elf, she has dark hair in a braid hanging over her shoulder. She‚Äôs wearing black leathers with a mask covering her mount & nose and a hood pulled over her head. A shortsword strapped to her back.
Image
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:18 PM
Bronwyn just lingers in the back listening to exchange happening in front of her
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:25 PM
[Not sure if Arden is included yet, but just incase he is] Arden Greenwood is a male Wood Elf with an autumnal palette; his long, wavy hair blends the rich browns, deep reds, and oranges of fallen leaves. His vibrant green eyes mirror the fresh foliage of the forest, and his skin has the warm, earthy hue of tree bark. He wears a cloak that mimics the forest‚Äôs own cloak of leaves, suggesting a seamless unity with nature. His overall demeanor is one of tranquility and deep spiritual connection to the natural world around him.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:40 PM
Looking at Bronwyn the old lady says "are you here to rob us... we don't have much..." and then seeing Arden she says "my dear boy, leaves are for outside."
Ky ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:42 PM
Tova will look for Peridot and share with Peridot and Ae'lun what she has heard about the goblins.

'The merchants say there are 100s of goblins. I think we should go see this Gregory and find out what he knows, but this may be a bigger problem then we can handle. We may need more fighters beside us'
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:53 PM
Lokking at Peridot, the young man says "I am sorry, we don't have any balls... I do have a bag of caltrops here somewhere though, there is like 20 of them in a bag. They are a little expensive though, 1gp for a bag" he rummages through a few crates and pulls out a leather pouch.
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:55 PM
Not here to rob anyone mam, there‚Äôs no honor in stealing from people with nothing, just looking for some information on the goblins.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/15/2024 4:56 PM
Peridot will turn to Tova "Let me grab these few things and we can go to Gregory." Then turns to the kid "Give me a bag and all the darts" and hands over 2 gold.

Hearing the request for information about the goblins "You are welcome to follow us to the town hall we are just about to go get some more info and from the sounds of it we need more hands on deck" 
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:01 PM
Arden smiles gently at the old lady, a twinkle of understanding in his vibrant green eyes. "Fear not, I only bring nature's gifts, not its litter," he assures her, his voice a soft murmur like the rustle of leaves. Turning to Tova and the rest, he nods solemnly, "Let us convene with Gregory. United, our roots run deeper and our branches reach further. I shall offer the wisdom of the wilds to guide our hands against the goblin tide."
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:03 PM
Bronwyn nods to Peridot ‚Äúlead the way‚Äù
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:07 PM
The young boy takes the 2gp and hands you a few silver in return, "thank you very much, if you need anything else I will be happy to help."

Does anyone need anything else while at the general store...?
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:09 PM
Arden leans down to the boy's level, his eyes soft but earnest. "Nature's cycles are generous; they give without asking for return. Such is the wisdom of Zivara," he says, handing the boy a single acorn from his pouch. "Plant this seed as you would plant kindness, and both will grow beyond your wildest dreams." With a warm, encouraging smile, he adds, "Should you ever seek the shelter of the woods or the guidance of the stars, remember her teachings, and you'll find a path to peace."
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:11 PM
I hand back the silver and say keep it
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:28 PM
The boy looking a little weirded out by arden just says "ok..." and turns to Peridot and say "are you sure... thank you!"

His mother looks at Arden "uh, what's a sahara" and then as if completely forgetting that she was even in conversation just turns around and heads to the back.
Ky ‚Äî 01/15/2024 5:29 PM
Tova doesn't think she needs anything at the moment ü§î
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/15/2024 6:07 PM
Arden, content in the exchange and with his thoughts turning to the task at hand, he readies himself to depart.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 7:28 PM
You make your way through town, past a dozen or so houses and a few buildings that seems to have closed, boarded up... a stable a warehouse and a shop of some kind.

You continue on and come to a large sturdy wooden bridge with flowers growing all along the sides. The bridge leads to a island building, the Town Hall and behind it a massive tree standing tall. Just beyond this you see a waterfall, probably 1000ft tall with green moss and shrubs growing at the base. A single tree grows along the wall of the mountainside.

As you enter the Town Hall and head over to the large desk that sits atop a landing following a small set of stairs you see a man. By the look on his face, he is in no mood for people. He has short black hair, dark eyes, clad in scale mail with a greatsword by his side. 

As you approach the man he does not look up but says "if you are here looking for guards to protect your caravans, I have already told you I don't have enough guards as it is..." Looking up and seeing the bunch of you he says "or perhaps if you are looking for work I have caravans in need of guards..."
Image
Ky ‚Äî 01/15/2024 7:35 PM
Tova will stand a little back from the table so that she doesn't look so small and say 'not either of those good sir, we come looking for information about the goblins in hopes that we may help you get rid of the problem'
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/15/2024 7:41 PM
Bronwyn nods in agreement with Tova and adds ‚ÄòI will offer up my services to help protect caravans bringing supplies into town in the meantime, too many people here are in need.‚Äô
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:00 PM
Peridot will walk over to Bronwyn and say "Not just yet my friend, we will require your help in cleaning out these goblins and with that we can make it safe in a more permanent manner "
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:04 PM
"Wherever I can be most useful"
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:16 PM
Ae'lun still lost in thought follows along, carefully picking his teeth with an arrow
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:42 PM
"Tell me dwarf... what will you do when you find these goblins... hundreds, maybe more?" He looks at the group, "did the king send you or are you just a bunch of fools looking for fame and glory? If you were sent by the king, then go back to him and tell him to send more men before I have to drag your corpses from the forest... if you are foolish enough to think you are able to rid this land of goblins you will find nothing but death...I will not send more men to their death. Go home!"
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:47 PM
‚ÄúExcuse me good sir I will have you know that myself and my companions here are more than capable enough to face of against these goblins of yours. I cant say about the others but I was sent here by the cobolt soul to assist you with this problem. As their most trusted and highly ranked monk I do not appreciate your tone and you seem to be in dire need of any help you can get.‚Äù And Peridot will show his noble symbol of duke. ‚Äú I am Peridot a duke of the realm‚Äù
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:52 PM
Ae'lun raises his hand "consider me a fool then, if it is foolish to want to put an end to this towns plight. I'm sure you know as well as I do that your supplies are running out"
Ky ‚Äî 01/15/2024 8:54 PM
'We come of our own accord to try and assist. And by what I have seen so far, you dont have many options but to let us try. Your people are dying, if the goblins don't get them, they will starve. You don't seem to be getting a whole lot of your supplies through to the town these days. ' let us help... Or try to... On our own heads be it
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/15/2024 9:44 PM
Arden steps forward, his presence as calming as the forest's whisper. "Guardian of this town, we are here not for titles or tales, but to walk the path of equilibrium that Zivara illuminates. The goblins disrupt this balance and threaten the cycle that nourishes us all. Let us tend to this wound, not as warriors seeking battle, but as keepers of peace seeking to restore the natural order." His tone is neither condemning nor boastful, but rather like a gentle stream ‚Äî persistent and full of life's resolve.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 3:28 PM
Gregory looks at all of you and says "fools, the lot of you...I tell you what, I don't think you can take on these goblins so let's make a little wager... you pick your best fighter and I will fight him or her one on one and if you win I will tell you what you need to know...if not, you all go home and perhaps survive this. Do we have a deal?"
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/16/2024 3:52 PM
Arden gathers the group in a huddle, away from Gregory's watchful gaze. "The challenge ahead requires not only strength but wisdom," he whispers. "We must choose one among us who embodies both, for this is not merely a test of combat, but of resolve. If we are to accept this wager, let us do so with clear intent and unity. And remember, the gifts of nature can fortify our champion, though we must use them judiciously, lest we betray the honor of this contest." He looks to his companions, seeking a consensus on who will step forward.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/16/2024 4:06 PM
Ae'lun looks around and says "Well I'm definitely out, I don't mean to fill Greg with arrows. although I must say, tis a shame we're not in the city, I would have been able to make some coin gambling on a fight like this"
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 4:15 PM
‚ÄúWill this be a no weapons fight or how do you want to do this‚Äù Peridot will say to gregory. And then to the group ‚ÄúAs a monk fighter I could take him on without issue, I just need to get up close and personal ‚Äú
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/16/2024 4:19 PM
Arden nods thoughtfully at Peridot's readiness to step forward. "Indeed, clarity on the terms of this contest is vital," he agrees. "Let us ascertain whether this is a test of martial prowess alone, or if other skills may come into play. Knowing the nature of the battle will guide us in choosing our strategy wisely." His gaze shifts back to Gregory, ready to seek further details about the challenge.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:29 PM
"If I wanted to kill you, I'd just send you out there... Non-lethal combat, we shall fight until one of us can no longer continue or forfeit." He steps into an open area in the centre of the Town Hall and draws his blade, gently resting it over his shoulder. The light of the morning sun gleaming from his polished plate mail as he stands ready.

[DM note... You are welcome to use any weapons including spells... the fight will continue untill someone surrenders or is knocked unconscious.]
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:31 PM
Then player question I have a quarterstaff that has 2 damage things 1 is a 1d6+6 and 1d8+6 but dont know if I can use both or only one for damage
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:32 PM
The damage there is give as a one handed attack vs a two handed attack. When holding with both hands yoy can do more damage.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:34 PM
And I still get my bonus action
Ky ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:37 PM
Tova will say to the group 'fighting for information to help their town is a strange idea, but I will take up the battle if there are none others that would want to'
Ky ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:37 PM
I think so, yea
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:39 PM
Yes... but you cannot use 2 weapon fighting with your staff as it is not a LIGHT melee weapon, if that is what you had in mind ü§î
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:40 PM

Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:41 PM
Correct me if I am wrong but I can use the staff and then bonus action unarmed attack?
But anyway back in character.

"I got this don't worry my friend, but be on standby for Gregory afterwards" and Peridot walks up and gets his staff ready dual handed
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:48 PM
Ae'lun sits on the ground with his legs crossed watching intently "This should be good"

I won't be using Avrae commands for this battle as Avrae takes a bit of learning so I'll just roll using custom rolls. You can roll on Avrae or you can roll your dice manually, doesn't matter, you choose... just remeber to add your modifier.

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/16/2024 5:59 PM
Arden quietly joins Ae'lun on the ground, adopting a lotus position as his eyes close gently. His hands rest on his knees, palms upward, as he begins to draw upon the tranquility around them. With a deep, measured breath, he enters a meditative state, seeking Zivara's blessing. The ambient sounds of nature seem to harmonize with his focus, creating an aura of serene energy around them, a subtle boon to Peridot's impending contest.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:03 PM

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:27 PM
What does your attack look like?
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:27 PM
Arden remains seated, his eyes closed in deep focus. Though he does not speak, the subtle shift in the air around him suggests a silent invocation, a druid's subtle way of lending support without direct interference, maintaining the sanctity of the one-on-one combat.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:29 PM
First I will run in closer using my staff to hit Gregory in the ribs then as the staff makes its way I will stomp it on the ground do a round house spin kick of it to kick Gregory in the face. Standing strong after that for his attacks to come
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:36 PM
Gregory, quite surprised by the speed of your attacks will wipe a little blood from his mouth and take a more readied stance... Gripping his sword tightly with both hands he lunges forward swinging...

!roll 1d20 + 3
17 + 3... dirty 20

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:47 PM
Swinging his sword he does... 9 slashing damage... and tries to strike a second time but misses as you bend out of the way and return with a punch to his ribs...however as your punch lands you feel as though a magical barrier ubsorbs the blow...

"I must say, I am quite impressed... you are better than I expected..."
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:48 PM
"Not to bad yourself, a shame you didnt take this last blow" As i take my staff to crack it on his head
19+8 for 27 to hit
6+6 for 12 damage 
Another ki point for flurry of blows
13+6 for another 19 to hit, and I will wait this time xD
Ky ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:53 PM
Tova will stand shaking her head, but secretly cheering Peridot on and taking note of what he can do in battle. She is eager to learn what they can about the goblins and itching for a valid fight
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:54 PM
Sorry i mistyped my damage its only a +6 so it makes it 12 not 14
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:56 PM
As you swing your staff down, he grabs at his holy symbol and is enveloped by a mist, narrowly escaping the blow and reappears about 20ft back...
"Not so easy to hit" he smiles
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:57 PM
I will run in closer using my staff as leverage to do a kick with that 19 to hit
"No escaping from my grasps"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:58 PM
You land a kick as he stumbles back...
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 6:59 PM
4+4 for 8 damage
and 14+6 for a dirty 20 as my final hit?
which I will use the momentum to swing around for another kick
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:01 PM
He blocks the fury of kicks, yet not able to block them all he takes another hit...
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:01 PM
3+4 for 7 damage
And I will finish with "Don't fall now"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:07 PM
He spits some blood onto the ground...laughs and says "Not just yet"  as he slams his blade into the ground infront of him you see a magical blade seemingly made from pure light decend upon you...

16 + 5 to hit
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:07 PM
Yes that will hit
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:09 PM
As the blade desend it burns with a magical radiance doing... 9 + 8 = 17  radiant damage... as he now stands holding onto his blade to keep him up.

Gregory slowly comes around and opens his eys seeing Au'lun standing over him... "My ribs are gonna from that one" he laughs... "Thanx for the help"

He gets up slowly and walks over to Peridot "you are much stronger than you look, perhaps you and your friend here could make a difference"
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:24 PM
"Not too bad yourself, if I broke anything sorry about that tried holding back but haven't had a food sparring in a while"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:37 PM
Come, let us discuss the matter with a drink as he leads the entire group to a large room, holding his ribs and limping slightly as he walks. As he opens the large wooden doors, you notice a map of the area spread open on the table and a few papers rolled up. A young girl is busy tidying up the room as you walk in... she looks are Gregory and you can see the concern in her eyes, yet she says nothing. He looks a the girl and says "please get my new friends something to drink...he leans down, lots of ale for the dwarf and perhaps something more appropriate for our forest flower over there"
Ky ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:38 PM

Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/16/2024 7:48 PM
"The best ale is free ale! Wait this is free right?"
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/16/2024 9:16 PM
Arden responds with humility and grace, reflecting the philosophies of Zivara and says,

"Gregory, while the offer of ale and a seat at your table is kindly met, it's not the way of Zivara to have others serve us. We partake as equals, sharing in the labor and the fruits it bears. As it's said in the Lumynar, each act of giving is also an act of receiving, binding us closer to life. I'll pour for us, and together we'll toast to the health of this town and the forests that embrace it."

Arden then proceed to serve the others and then himself, ensuring that the girl is included as a guest, not as a servant, to honor the teachings of unity and interconnectedness from the Zivara Lumynar.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/16/2024 10:08 PM
Ae'lun softly nudges Bronwyn and whispers "did this guy eat some really good mushrooms or is he always this... Colorful?" Gesturing towards Arden
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/16/2024 10:16 PM
"Oh... my apologies...uh water?" he says to Bronwyn and then turns to Au'lan and says "yes it's free." 

"As Arden hands each a cup, the girl kindly takes her cup and excuses herself, "thank you for the drink, I uh, am needed elsewhere... I am no fighter" she says and walks off.

Gregory arranges a few things on the table and opens a scroll with a handwritten message. "Goblins are not known for their intelligence, yet they use tactics equal to that of a soldier. They hide in the forest, waiting, watching... We don't have much information to go on, very few soldier ever make it back and the ones that do have very different tales to tell. Some say there are demons helping the goblins, others say the forest itself attacked them as they tried to track the goblins to their hideout.

From what we have been able to find we know that the goblins are not working alone, they have help...someone or something is leading them.

We have also identified 2 places just beyond the woods that we believe they might be hiding in... one is a cavern deep in the mountain, another is an old tomb of a group of knights. My men has seen Hobgoblins pateoling the area so there is definitely something there.

I'd suggest you start at one of these spots. The tomb might be closer about a day's worth of travel, easier terrain... the caverns in the mountain side is about 2 days if the weather holds.

I'd offer you some horses, but our stable hand was killed a few days ago and the horses driven off by a goblin attack. Our guards managed to drive them out of town, but we lost the horses.
WildFlower ‚Äî 01/16/2024 10:25 PM
"From what I've seen he's quite colorful" Bronwyn says and holds out her cup for Ae'lun to cheers. üçª
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/16/2024 10:32 PM
Arden, maintaining the tranquil air of a serene guardian of the forest, nods thoughtfully at Gregory's information. He then rises, approaches the table, and hovers his hand over the map. "The land speaks to us," he murmurs. "Let us listen to its whispers to guide us to these goblins." Closing his eyes briefly, he places a finger on the map, as if divining a path through the natural world's unseen connections. "To the tomb first, for it may hold clues to this unnatural alliance," he suggests, opening his eyes to gauge the group's reaction.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/16/2024 10:40 PM
Peridot still on the floor to attempt a short rest but still having a big smile on his face replaying the fight he just had in his mind
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/16/2024 10:40 PM
Ae'lun picks up his cup and returns the gesture "well at the very least it seems the journey won't be a dull one" he then turns to the group "I agree that the tomb would be a good place to start, it may not hold the key to defeating this evil but at the very least it may loosen their foothold in the area"
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/17/2024 9:55 AM
(Player question, can I rebuild Ae'lun? All his stats and stuff would be identical I mostly want to change his subclass from hunter to beastmaster if there is a way to do it)
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/17/2024 11:20 AM

Is there anything anyone would like to ask Gregory or do in town before yoy head out?
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/17/2024 11:23 AM
Could i stay to get a short rest in. Desperately needed
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/17/2024 11:24 AM
You can get a short rest in the time you spend talking to Gregory and just relaxing with a drink.
Ky ‚Äî 01/17/2024 11:25 AM
Tova will ask ' is there perhaps a map of the area that we can make use of? I agree, I think the tomb is a good starting point. What do you know of the area around the tomb? Can we approach it without being see, is there tree cover maybe? Is there a good way to approach it perhaps. So that we can try to do some recon before running into something we don't yet fully understand.'
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/17/2024 11:34 AM
Arden, respecting the group's need to rest and strategize, decides to use this time to commune with nature. He steps outside the Town Hall, finding a quiet spot where the earth's energy is strong. There, he meditates, reaching out with his senses to the living essence of the land, seeking guidance and insight that might aid their upcoming journey to the tomb. He remains still, a sentinel attuned to the whispers of the wind and the murmurs of the earth.

Arden, after concluding his commune with nature, senses the arrival of new energies ‚Äî Trougax and Enyawd. He decides to greet the new allies, understanding the value of every hand in their quest. Making his way back to the Town Hall, he looks for signs of readiness among his companions, his thoughts already on the path ahead. With a respectful nod to the newcomers, he subtly assesses their strength and spirit, considering how they might harmonize with the group's dynamic.

Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/17/2024 8:44 PM
A few minutes later he holds up a crudely drawn picture of the front gate of the town with a sign that reads "Ae'lensburg" he smiles and says "has a nice ring to it I'd say!"
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/17/2024 8:53 PM
Arden observes Ae'lun's light-hearted moment with a quill and offers a gentle smile, appreciating the levity. He then approaches Enyawd, acknowledging his vow with a nod of respect. "Welcome, Enyawd. In our circle, trust is the root from which strength grows," he says.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/17/2024 9:19 PM
Au'lun... if you want to attempt to draw the map you can give me your choice of... Slight of Hand just to copy it as it is, Nature to draw on the natural landscape to give details such as terrain, or any other skill... if you are able to defend your use of it ü§î
You are all standing there looking at the map, talking about the map and it is the size of the entire table... unless you would get Gregory out of the room I'd say it wouldn't be possible to steal it without him noticing.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/17/2024 9:20 PM
Ae'lun, do you still require arrows? I have 20 which I can hand over to you... Or would you like me to carry them for you until later?
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/17/2024 9:24 PM
Arden gently suggests, "Ae'lun, perhaps I could assist with adding some of the natural details to the map. My time spent in these forests has familiarized me with their nuances, which could be invaluable for our journey." He offers this as a mere suggestion, leaving the final decision to the group.

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/17/2024 9:45 PM
Arden watches the group's attempts at map-making, his gaze flitting from one member to another with a light-hearted amusement in his eyes. Despite his suggestion and considerable knowledge of the forests, it seems his offer was overshadowed by the group's immediate efforts. He silently chuckles to himself, reflecting on the irony that, despite his age and experience, he might still be seen as a mere youngster in the eyes of his companions. Arden's smile widens subtly, finding humor in the situation as he observes the unfolding map chaos.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/17/2024 10:10 PM
Gregory, finding their attempts amusing, suggest that his daughter, the young woman you met earlier could assist with a copy. As the official scribe for Windcrest she will be able to assist.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/17/2024 10:12 PM

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/17/2024 10:16 PM
Arden, observing the group's struggles and the latest offer of assistance from Gregory, nods in agreement. He silently appreciates the collective effort and acknowledges that utilizing the skills of the town's official scribe is a sensible course of action. Arden stands by, ready to provide any additional insight or support as needed, his demeanor calm and patient.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/17/2024 10:22 PM

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/17/2024 10:37 PM
Arden takes this moment to engage with his companions, sharing his insights and experiences in line with Zivara's teachings. He speaks of the interconnectedness of all life and the importance of understanding and respecting the natural world around them. His words are an invitation to reflect on their journey ahead, not just as a physical path, but as a spiritual one, guided by the principles of harmony and balance as taught in the Zivara Lumynar.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/18/2024 6:57 AM
Enyawd listens attentively to Arden's insights. Nodding to show his understanding and taking a moment to purposefully visualise the challenge that may lie ahead... The woven connectedness again proven by his knowledge of the goblin tongue, which will surely be useful on the quests ahead.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/18/2024 8:27 AM
Gregory hands the map to Tova, as she was the one to request more strategic clarity, and pints out that the tomb is surrounded by forest on all sides. "It is built into a cliff face so approaching from the South might give you some advantage, however due to how thick the jungle is here it might be hard to see. Unfortunately I do not have more information."

Gregort then walks over to a cabinet and pulls out 2 potion vials and hands it to Peridot, "perhaps this will come in handy."

"Camping in the Grey Skull Forest is no easy task, make sure you stay alert... the forest is always watching . I have lost many men, if you find them, please bring me something by which they can be recognized so I can notify their families."
Ky ‚Äî 01/18/2024 8:55 AM
Tova will take the map and listen intently to the advice Gregory has to give. She will then ask the group at large " Who all will fight the goblins? We could use as much willing hands, swords, bows and bravery as we can get. Might I suggest, those who wish to fight, we move to the tavern/inn and try to think about how we will approach the situation. With 100s of goblins out there and the unknown forces working with the goblins, I do not think rushing in is the best option."
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/18/2024 9:44 AM
"Enyawd Nightbeard fears not a goblin, for I speak their tongue. I shall journey forth with thee, Tova, and any other soul who seeks glory and justice. Now, let's make haste for I fear we need to rescue copious amounts of ale from the confining grasp of flagons."
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/18/2024 10:00 AM
Arden, embracing the call to action, nods in agreement with Tova's suggestion. He rises, ready to join the group at the tavern for strategic planning. With his deep knowledge of nature and the teachings of Zivara, he is prepared to offer insights on navigating the forest and dealing with the goblins tactfully. His focus remains on ensuring the group's unity and effectiveness in facing the challenges ahead.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/18/2024 10:25 AM

Armed with the knowledge gained from Gregory you head back to the inn, once again passing the merchants nou sitting at some of the tables outside sharing a drink and telling tales of their adventures. The innkeep greets you once again and says "I trust your meeting with Gregory was productive...? I see you have a few extra members in your group, good. As one looks out for others, so they will look out for you. Anything you need, just let me know" and then he walks off towards the merchants and continues conversation with them.

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/18/2024 3:02 PM
Arden prepares for the journey ahead. He gathers herbs and natural materials, utilizing his proficiency with the Herbalism Kit. With his deep understanding of the forest, he also offers practical advice to the group on navigating the terrain, emphasizing the importance of respecting the natural environment in line with Zivara's teachings. His actions are deliberate and thoughtful, reflecting his commitment to the group's success and the balance of the natural world.

"I should probably get back to Shnuggles at some point, poor thing probably thinks I'm dead by now"
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/18/2024 7:05 PM
Arden nods understandingly at Ae'lun's concern for Shnuggles. "It's important to ensure our companions are safe and content. Lupo, my dire wolf companion raised since he was a cub, resides in a serene part of the nearby forest, a sanctuary known to my kin. It's a place where Wood Elves commune with nature. Lupo would surely appreciate the company of Shnuggles. They can keep each other company and remain safe while we're on our journey." He offers this as a thoughtful solution, understanding the bond between adventurers and their animal companions.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/18/2024 8:21 PM
"does Lupo play fetch? Shnuggles is unnaturaly good at that" 
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/18/2024 8:54 PM
Arden chuckles warmly, "Lupo has a playful side, especially when it comes to fetch. He'll certainly enjoy Shnuggles' company and their games. It's a sight to behold, a dire wolf engaged in such simple joys." His eyes glint with fondness at the thought. "They'll be good for each other, I believe."
Ky ‚Äî 01/19/2024 12:21 AM
Tova will say  "It is a good idea if we gather any weapons or equipment we may need. Arden, is there something that may help us navigate the forest that we should be getting or preparing?" 
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/19/2024 1:00 AM
Arden responds thoughtfully, "In the forest, awareness is our best tool. I've prepared well for us with herbs and materials, but it's crucial to remain alert to the subtle signs of nature. Trusting our instincts, listening to the whispers of the wind, and observing the patterns of wildlife will guide us more than any physical tool. Let's ensure we're all equipped with essentials like water and food, nature will provide us with shelter, but remember, the forest itself will be a guide and ally in our journey."
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 6:42 AM

I think it should be around midday by this time.

Tova will ask if the group thinks we should take the rest of the day to prepare and then leave at first light or is there a better time to leave? Traveling through the dense forest at night doesn't seem like a good idea anyway. 
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/19/2024 11:59 AM
Peridot will agree with tova as he has no food for travel and this gives those who used spells to get them back
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/19/2024 12:51 PM
Arden agrees that it might be best to leave at first light. "Indeed, departing with the dawn aligns us with the natural rhythm of the forest. It allows us to use the light of day to navigate more safely through the dense woods. Tonight, we can finalize our preparations, rest, and ensure we are all mentally and physically ready for the journey ahead." His tone is calm and reassuring, emphasizing the importance of being in harmony with their surroundings.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 1:49 PM
Enyawd agrees and approaches the merchants to procure some rations for the travels ahead. "How much for your rations, dear merchant?" before adding "and perhaps a treat for these two's animal companions?" while tilting a head towards Arden and Peridot.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/19/2024 1:50 PM
Enyawd, just looking around at the different wagons of the merchants that just came into town, don't seem to find anything of particular interest.

The innkeep will be happy to supply rations to anyone in need, only asking 3sp per day's worth of rations per person, with a few treats free of charge for your animal friends and points Arden to one of the merchants who sells rare herbs and components in the creation of potions and spells. The town being small and in short supply of weapons does not have much to offer in terms of such.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 1:54 PM
Enyawd approaches the inkeep. "A night's rest and 3 days ration for each of my party, if you would be so kind."
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/19/2024 1:58 PM
Arden heads to the merchant selling rare herbs and components, his eyes searching for specific items that could be crucial on their journey. He looks particularly for "Lunaria Silvatica", a rare herb known only by a few for its potent healing properties and its ability to enhance one's connection with natural surroundings. This herb, when brewed into a tea or used in poultices, can significantly accelerate healing and provide a heightened sense of awareness in forested environments, making it invaluable for their trek through the dense woods. 
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 2:01 PM
[side note] I just realised I have proficiency and expertise in perception "Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies."
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/19/2024 3:22 PM
Enyawd as you step back from the wagons, not really finding something to your taste, one of the merchants that was quietly observing the group steps out behind you and says "you seem to be a man with a specific taste, a taste for something special... perhaps I may be of service. You tell me what it is that you need and I will see if I can do...at a price off course."

Arden, the merchant heads over to his wagon and takes a small chest from it, then in the blink of an eye, with a sleight of hand makes a key appear and unlocks the chest. "This is the herb you seek, but... it is very rare to come by, rare and expensive... 25gp and I will add this tea infuser  able to extract to it's maximum potential the special essence of this herb."
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 3:40 PM
Enyawd greets the merchant. "I seek the bane of goblins. Something that will strike fear into their hearts or perchance a warhammer to smite the scum and turn them to paste."
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/19/2024 4:34 PM
Arden approaches the merchant with a respectful demeanor, channeling the teachings of Zivara. He speaks earnestly, "This herb, 'Lunaria Silvatica', is more than a commodity. It's a vital element in maintaining the balance of nature, which we strive to protect. In the hands of those who respect and understand its value, it can do much good. I humbly request that you consider the broader impact of our mission and how this herb could aid not just us, but the very essence of the forest we seek to safeguard." Arden's appeal is heartfelt, hoping to resonate with the merchant's sense of being part of a larger, interconnected world.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/19/2024 5:32 PM
"The goblin paster now that would be a hammer"
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/19/2024 9:54 PM
Enyawd, the merchant thinks for a moment and then says "Yes, such a weapon does exist, a weapon of great power, a weapon of great deeds... truely special... yes such a weapon the purveyor can provide, but are you willing to pay the price... yes the price are you willing to pay it?"

The merchant turns to Arden and then looks around at the town..."Look buddy, this here town is going to be overrun by goblins soon and I ain't planning to stick around for that, I'm using that money to get the hell out of here. You can either pay the price or leaf it... get it... leaf it..." he laughs to himself. "Look I don't want to be the bad guy here, but I have places to be and a family to provide for. Traveling these roads aren't cheap, and I need the money. So what say you?"
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 10:07 PM
Looking the merchant in the eye, Enyawd says "Surely the quality of such an item would influence the price. Let me hold the item and feel its balance in my hands. Then you may tell me what your price is for it." 
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/19/2024 10:20 PM
Arden's expression shifts subtly to one of mild disappointment, mixed with understanding. "While I must express my regret at being unable to acquire the 'Lunaria Silvatica' at this price, I respect the need for your own sustenance in these trying times," he says with a slight, knowing smile. "Fortunately, the forest has been a generous teacher, and I am well-versed in finding what we need from its bounty." He offers a cordial nod to the merchant, adding, "Perhaps another time, our paths will cross in a more fruitful exchange." With this, Arden steps away, his spirits undiminished, ready to rely on his own skills and the gifts of nature.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/19/2024 10:25 PM
Enyawd, make a persuasion check as you are saying this to rhe merchant.

Arden, the merchant clearly disappointed walks off and you hear him say under his breath "I'll just find someone else willing to pay the price... people just expect me to give things away for free, do they know how hard it is to find these things..." and continues to mutter some more as he walks out of sight.
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/19/2024 10:49 PM
Arden, undeterred by the merchant's reaction, focuses on rejoining his companions. He calmly walks back to the inn, prepared to share his insights on the forest and the journey ahead. His confidence in their collective abilities and the resources nature provides remains strong.

The merchant, looking a little hesitant says "but of course, how else shall one know whether it is a fair trade if one is not able to inspect such a weapon." He walks over to behind one of the wagons and promptly return is a magnificent Warhammer. Masterfully crafted, a slender steel shaft wrapped in fine black leather bears a goblin-skull shaped hammer head. Along the shaft hidden beneath the leather is the edged elven script that lends to the hammer it's magical power. With the power of 3 men you would swing this hammer and no goblin would stand against you. But be warned the power it has is hard to wield" and he holds it out to you to accept.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/19/2024 11:27 PM
Enyawd reaches out and takes the warhammer. He practices a few select moves and grins. "This shall suit me well on our journey. Speak your price and be gentle on the purse, for the sake of your town might depend on the might of this magnificent piece."
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/19/2024 11:56 PM
As you swing the warhammer from side to side you feel the magnificent power that this warhammer could unleash. With each swing it feels as though you have the strength of 3 men... Looking at the merchant he gently smiles "the price I ask though heavy  has already been paid, for the price is only that you accept this weapon willingly... that you have done. Go and wield this weapon against the forces that threaten these lands. The purveyor bids you farewell, perhaps our paths shall cross again." As he steps away and disappears in between the merchants wagons.

You can add to your sheet the following - Warhammer. This one has to be customized with the following properties...

Damage is 3d8 (Not 1d8)

This is a cursed item and once accepted it is bound to you and you to it. Should you die, the hammer will be destroyed...should the hammer be destroyed you will die.

Whenever this warhammer is 30ft or more from you it will automatically return to your hand. 

When making an attack roll against any creature other than a Goblin with this weapon you must first roll 1d20, if the roll is 1-10 you automatically miss the attack and the weapon's unstable magical energies explode and causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage to you. If you roll an 11-20 you are able to control the energies and direct it as normal with no damage to you.

Whenever you try to attack any creature other than a goblin with any other weapon besides this weapon, you must roll 1d20. On a 1-10 your attack automatically fails. On an 11-20 you may attack as normal.

Arden finds a tranquil spot in the inn's garden, a serene space filled with lush greenery and the soft sounds of nature. Here, he settles down, allowing the calm surroundings to enhance his meditation. The garden, with its gentle rustling leaves and the harmony of chirping birds, provides the perfect backdrop for Arden to connect deeply with the natural world and the principles of Zivara.

Enyawd, as you head over to the blacksmith's forge you find that he is not there. There is a note pinned to the wooden door of the forge with a large iron spike - Closed. Be back in 2 days.

If there is nothing specific any of the characters wants to do in Windcrest then you all meet up the next morning after a good night's rest and for some a restful meditation and others a good hearty breakfast.

As Arden conducts his survival check, he attentively scans the environment, using his deep understanding of the forest to guide him. He looks for subtle signs in the flora and fauna that could indicate the safest paths or potential dangers. His eyes carefully observe the ground for tracks or disturbances, his ears tuned to the natural sounds of the forest, discerning anything out of the ordinary. He touches leaves, sniffs the air, and sometimes pauses to feel the direction of the wind, all while moving forward with a calm and focused demeanor.

Traveling deeper and deeper, Arden meticulously following the gentle guidance of the forest. Yet the nature of the forest is both kind and cruel, like the gods it both gives and takes away. Navigating in the dense undergrowth of the Grey Skull Forest is much more challenging than anticipated, combined with the inaccuracies of the map, not because if was incorrectly scribed, but because those who did so were deceived by the forest.

Listening and scanning the edges of your view for any danger, Tova and Peridot find themselves tiring quickly. Although little wildlife makes it self known to you, movement seems to be constant, your eyes darting at regular intervals at the rustling leaves and the sounds of footsteps.

Enyawd and Au'lun bringing up the rear constantly find themselves looking to the back trying to pinpoint the ever present shadows that seem to follow them as the forest grows thicker and light starts to fade.

After what seems like forever you find yourself staring at a great chasm. Looking at the map, the detail seems lost but for a faint line drawn as though by accident. By estimate 120ft wide and with no end in sight you stand at the edge.
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/21/2024 11:00 PM
Arden tells the group that he will use his Wild Shape ability to transform into a Golden Eagle, known for its keen eyesight and ability to fly long distances. As a Golden Eagle, he will take to the sky, soaring above the chasm to scout the area swiftly. With the sharp vision, it will allow him to look for a safer and more navigable crossing point for the group, making the most of his transformed form's ability to cover a large area quickly and observe from a vantage point. He will then return to the group with the recon information and lead the group onward.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/21/2024 11:16 PM
Ae'lun looks over the chasm's edge "nope theres no way we get all of us across that! Well Maybe.... No that probably wouldn't work either" he then sits on a rock looking toward the road they just came in on
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/22/2024 12:15 AM
Standing at the edge of the cliff, Arden communes with the forest, whispering a few words to Zivara and then draws from nature the ability to transform into a bird, yet you see not before you the splendor of a Golden Eagle, but rather the wedge-shaped beak of an axe beak, a flightless bird with strong legs and a bad attitude (Lv. 3 druid can only wild shape into a creature of challenge rating 1/4 and with no flying or swimming speed).

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/22/2024 12:23 AM
[didn't realize there was more to the description if you clicked it on dndbeyond, the main description was quite deceptive, told me "you can magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before twice per short rest. You can stay in beast shape for 1 hours before reverting back to your normal form", wasn't aware of level limitations, but it makes sense. Lesson learned üôÇ]

---

Arden, using this form, will methodically scout the perimeter of the chasm, searching for any natural crossings or paths that may be less visible from their current position that might be used to traverse it safely. He relies on his heightened senses in this form to detect any subtle trails or markers missed in their earlier observation, as well as the strong legs to sprint quickly and occasionally leap into the air a few meters, using the short time in the air as a more optimal vantage point. 
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/22/2024 6:22 AM
Enyawd looks at the trees... How tall are these? he wonders
Ky ‚Äî 01/22/2024 10:30 AM
Tova will scan the area around them, stepping forward a bit. She will be at the ready with her Warhammer just incase. She will look at chasm... Is it at all possible to climb down one side and up the next? Dies it seems like a place goblins might rush out of for an attack ü§î we might have to walk along one side and see if there is any way to cross further up or down. 

She will also ask the group at large if anyone has a spell that could help get us across.
Jarrod ‚Äî 01/22/2024 11:30 AM
More or less how far across is this chasm? Peridot will throw one of his caltrops down and listen for when it lands to determine how far down it is

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/22/2024 5:02 PM
The chasm is about 120ft wide (accross) it stretches from left to right as far as you can see (so going around it would add quite some time to your journey, yet could be possible should you travel a few hours either left or right to find a way around). As far as how deep the chasm is, looking down you estimate about 900m (3000ft).

Arden, now as an Axe Beak you run along the length of the chasm, sesrching for a way accross while your companions are trying to see if they could in some way make it down and up.

Tova and Peridot, looking down the side of the mountain has many slopes and crevices, loose rocks and trees... climbing down would be possible, however could be time consuming and dangerous for some of the lesser agile members of the party.

Enyawd, while everyone is investigating the surrounding areas, you climb onto a rock and spot way off into the distance what could be a bridge. This is echoed by Arden on his return, indeed a bridge or what is left of it. Traveling to the bridge would mean about another 40min walk, yet could be a viable means of crossing should it be intact.
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî 01/22/2024 5:08 PM
I would propose we send axe beak arden ahead to scout the bridge while the rest of the party plod their way to the bridge
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/22/2024 5:27 PM
Arden, still in his Axe Beak form, shares his findings from the previous scouting mission with the group. He explains that during his patrol along the chasm's perimeter, he didn't find any natural paths or crossings that would be suitable for the party. However, he notes that he did also see what appears to be a bridge in the distance. While he couldn't get a detailed view, the bridge seemed to be somewhat intact. It could potentially provide a viable crossing point, but he stresses the need for closer inspection to assess its current state and safety. He quickly scurries off toward the location of the bridge so that he may return and note his findings.
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî 01/22/2024 5:54 PM

Arden... give me a perception check as you are going out ahead of the party alone at quite the speed, being about 5min ahead of Peridot.

Peridot, is this before you head to the bridge or at the bridge?

Au'lun... looking around you don't see any tracks other than that of a few small animals and the party tracking through the forest, however listening to the forest you do notice a disturbance, birds suddenly swarm from the trees and you feel a slight tremble in the earth beneath your feet.

Shouting out to Tova and Enyawd they both start to move away from the edge of the cliff as an earthquake, growing with every passing moment rocks the mountainside.

Tova, slow in her armour starts running as the earth beneath her feet start to give way... Tova, please make me a dex saving as you are trying to avoid being swallowd by the collapsing rocks beneath your feat.

Peridot, as this is happening you cling to the tree not to be knocked out, please give me a strength saving throw.

Arden, being quite far ahead, you hear the faint screams from Au'lun to watch out and then a moment later feel the wrath of mother earth shaking violently. Although the earthquake shakes the ground and causes some damage to the forest, your legs are strong and stand fast, however as you are occupied by the forces of nature you fail to notice 2 wild boars running out of the undergrowth heading for you... please roll for initiative.

In this form, he plans to use his agility and strength to effectively engage in combat while also being mindful of the surrounding environment, which is still unsettled from the earthquake.

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî 01/22/2024 11:35 PM
Arden decides not to engage in combat with the wild boars, recognizing their behavior as more fear-driven than aggressive. He maintains his distance, using his agility to avoid any potential conflict. His focus remains on ensuring the safety of both himself and the boars, respecting the natural order and acting in accordance with the principles of Zivara, which emphasize harmony with all living creatures.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî 01/22/2024 11:40 PM
The wild boars, not seeing Arden as a threat will run past him and keep moving away...The danger seemingly past for now, yet now a the bridge, you can see it more clearly. Having been constructed long ago and left to the elements and perhaps the misuse of the goblins. What was one a suspended wooden rope bridge is now only 2 ropes, one on top and one on the bottom, held down by 2 rotten wooden posts, one on your side and thr other on the opposite side. Crossing would be dangerous, very dangerous üò≥

If possible, he plans to utilize naturally felled lumber and strong vines from the forest, aiming to strengthen the bridge for safer passage.

Wow... Big rolls tonight üò±

Au'lun and Arden, as you float gently across this chasm using the worn-out ropes of the existing bridge to guide your movement, you find yourself just over half way across when you hear these high-pitched cackling sounds coming from the side you just left. Your eyes immediately drawn to the noice now start to see movement in the undergrowth, trees rustling, branches breaking...

Glancing back in the direction you are heading, on the edge of the mountain, next to the post your rope is currently tied to you see a humanoid creature, skull-like face, wearing blue robes, hooded and wielding a dagger in both hands. 
Image
Tova, Peridot and Enyawd... as you stand ready scanning the treeline 15ft away you start to hear similar high-pitched cackling sounds. From what you can tell,.something is heading your way...probably 100ft away, but closing fast.

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî Yesterday at 12:38 AM
Arden thinks quickly. Utilizing his small size and agility as a rat, decides to create a distraction. He leaps off of Ae'lun's shoulder and scurries around the old ropes, creating a slight but noticeable movement that might draw attention away from Ae'lun, giving him a chance to finish securing the rope. This diversion, combined with Arden's small and inconspicuous form, will hopefully buy the group a few critical moments needed for Ae'lun to complete their task and retreat to safety.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Yesterday at 12:16 PM
Arden, in rat form,leaps from Au'lun and onto the rope now running along the rope to distract whatever it is standing on the other side of the chasm. Au'lun, while trying to hold onto the old worn-out rope ties the new rope around his waist and continues to make his way towards the humanoid creature. 

The humanoid surveys the area, seeing Au'lun and a rat making their way closer, he looks accross to the rustling trees and then as if startled  he looks to his right and slightly up seeing a large bird like creature, with 2 sets of eyes, colourful white, red, yellow and blue tones, and a wingspan 8ft wide approaching about 60ft away...heading straight for Arden, still in rat form.

At the same time Tova, now taking a more solid stance, prepares to unleash the might granted to her by her god, Berronar Truesilver. Peridot, runs forward first in line to meet the danger. Enyawd, readying himself, yet pondering the intentions of the foe on the other side.

Peridot, Enyawd and Tova... As you stand ready, you see 3 Grey Skull Goblins each with a scimitar in hand leaping from the concealment offered by the undergrowth, screaming something in goblin and then rushing forward. With Peridot in the front, 1 of the goblins will immediately single him out and target him for an attack. First trying to swipe at you with his claws and then using the scimitar in his other hand to try and swing at you.

Bound to you and you to it. Should you die, the hammer will be destroyed...should the hammer be destroyed you will die. Whenever this warhammer is 30ft or more from you it will automatically return to your hand. When making an attack roll against any creature other than a Goblin with this weapon you must first roll 1d20, if the roll is 1-10 you automatically miss the attack and the weapon's unstable magical energies explode and causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage to you. If you roll an 11-20 you are able to control the energies and direct it as normal with no damage to you. Whenever you try to attack any creature other than a goblin with any other weapon besides this weapon, you must roll 1d20. On a 1-10 your attack automatically fails. On an 11-20 you may attack as normal.

Not yet... Au'lun is still floating around bringing the rope...üòÇ You have managed to scare the bird off and now on the other side the 3 other memebers are still dealing with 2 goblins
He is next in order... if the 2 of you agree and want to swop out turns (technically holding your action until he has done his) so he can try and bring the rope over I will allow
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:43 PM

Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî Today at 8:02 AM
Alright cool then Ae'lun floats back up and uses dash to try pull himself the rest of the way accross
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 9:25 AM
You can definitly do so, moving hand over hand quickly floating accross with Arden now also there.

If there is nothing else, Arden you are up.
Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî Today at 10:44 AM
Arden, keenly aware of the urgency of the moment, assists Au'lun in untying the rope from his waist. Together, they work swiftly to secure the rope to the most robust anchor posts available on their side of the bridge. With a practiced eye, Arden selects the sturdiest lumber from the immediate area, reinforcing the anchoring points to ensure the safety and stability of their makeshift bridge. His actions are precise and deliberate.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 11:12 AM
Using your skills in nature you can definitly create a more secure post for the rope and tie it around, sure that it would hold even the heavier armoured amoung you.

I assume that is all for now... Then Tova, you are up.

Moonbeam
2nd-level evocation. (Druid, Moon Domain, Oath of the Ancients, Oath of the Watchers, Twilight Domain)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 120 feet (5 ft. cylinder)
Components: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description
A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

When a creature enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can't assume a different form until it leaves the spell's light.

On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an action to move the beam up to 60 feet in any direction.
At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

The goblin, seeing that it is out numbered is gonna try and make a run for it, he will try and leap over Peridot, swing his scimitar while doing so and then run off... This will require an Acrobatics check from the goblin and also trigger al 3 characters to have an attack of opportunity...

Enyawd Nightbeard attacks with a Goblinsbane 3d8!
Meta
To Hit: 1d20 (11) = 11
Damage: Waiting for roll...
Effect
Bound to you and you to it. Should you die, the hammer will be destroyed...should the hammer be destroyed you will die. Whenever this warhammer is 30ft or more from you it will automatically return to your hand. When making an attack roll against any creature other than a Goblin with this weapon you must first roll 1d20, if the roll is 1-10 you automatically miss the attack and the weapon's unstable magical energies explode and causes 3d8 bludgeoning damage to you. If you roll an 11-20 you are able to control the energies and direct it as normal with no damage to you. Whenever you try to attack any creature other than a goblin with any other weapon besides this weapon, you must roll 1d20. On a 1-10 your attack automatically fails. On an 11-20 you may attack as normal.

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî Yesterday at 11:37 PM
I think companions/pets might be able to attack on their own, but not if you want it to attack a specific target. So it would likely just target the nearest enemy and then attack it, without using your action -  I could be wrong though, but that's how I understand it
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî Today at 6:34 AM
I thought Shnuggles was staying behind at the village?
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 3:32 PM
Dungeons and Dragons 5e does a very poor job of integrating use of companions or pets, so it usually falls to the DM to really decide.

There are rules for classes like the Beastmaster Ranger that would apply, but it doesn't give a lot of info for other classes. RAW does say that it takes an action to command your companion to attack or do something specific and if not issued a command it will take the dodge action on its turn.

That said, it also depends on how long you have had your pet, what the intelligence of the pet is, how much downtime do you have, how much time are you willing to spend to train the pet etc. Taking all those into consideration I would possible allow (house rule) to command a pet with a single word command as a bonus action (depending on intelligence).

Beyond all of that...there is one rule I use above all. If your pet is only for role play purposes it will have plot armour, meaning I won't let it be attacked or killed unless it is a specific plot point to rescue it or something. If you want to let your pet go into battle, then it is fair game and usually an easier target for some enemies than a human with armour and able to defend itself and thus would probably not last all that long.

Also small things like fire might scare them or magic or something of the sort.

Levitate
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 60 feet
Components: V, S, M (either a small leather loop or a piece of golden wire bent into a cup shape with a long shank on one end)
Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes
Description
One creature or loose object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell's range.

When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft.

Arden, still hanging from the rope bridge, feels the ebbing flow of the Moonbeam's energy. With a final chant, he closes the conduit of lunar power, allowing the silvery light to fade into the forest's ambient glow. Carefully, he maneuvers his way back to solid ground, his movements echoing the graceful descent of autumn leaves. Once safely on solid ground, he steps back from the chasm's edge, his breathing deep and heavy from the exertion and focus required.

In this moment of respite, Arden decides to center himself with a brief meditation. Seating himself upon the earth, he closes his eyes and draws upon the tranquility of the natural world around him. His mind drifts to the teachings of Zivara, finding solace in the interconnectedness of all life. As he meditates, his breathing steadies, and the forest's subtle symphony of rustling leaves and distant sounds envelops him, reinforcing his resolve and rejuvenating his spirit as he awaits the reunion with his companions.

Looking past Peridot and Enyawd you see Tova near the edge of a chasm spanning 120ft accross. Tied to an old wooden post is the remains of a wooden bridge in the form of 2 ropes one ontop of the other. Next to the old post is a newly made post carved recently, much sturdier with a vine-like rope joined with normal hemp rope hanging accross the chasm tied to another post on the other side with two characters standing on the other end.

Tova is a short (even by drawf standards), stocky female dwarf with bright red hair and and Warhammer almost as big as she is. She's clad in armor and currently sweating, dirt stained and frustrated as hell. If looks could kill, we wouldn't have a goblin problem anymore

Tova will also start moving towards the rope

Arden is a Wood Elf Druid, and has a distinct and natural appearance. He has warm, earthy skin tones, reminiscent of the forest floor. His eyes are a vibrant green, echoing the hue of fresh leaves, full of life and wisdom. His hair is long and wavy, adorned with hues of autumn, ranging from deep browns to golden yellows, reflecting his deep connection to the natural world. Arden's presence is both calming and commanding, embodying the spirit of the ancient woods he protects. As a follower of Zivara and a guardian of the forest, his appearance is a testament to his life's devotion to nature and its preservation.

Enlarge/Reduce
2nd-level transmutation. (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)
Meta
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: 30 feet
Components: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute
Description
You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature returns to normal size at once.

Enlarge. The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category-- from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage.
Reduce. The target's size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category--from Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target's attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).

Arden, deeply rooted in his meditative state, continues to draw upon the tranquility and balance of the natural world around him. His breathing remains steady and measured, each inhale and exhale resonating with the subtle rhythms of the forest. In this serene state, he focuses his thoughts on the wellbeing of his companions and the restoration of harmony disrupted by the goblin threat. The ambient sounds of nature blend with his calm presence, creating a peaceful aura that extends subtly to those around him. As he waits for the others to join him and Ae'lun, Arden's meditation becomes a quiet yet powerful testament to his deep spiritual connection with the natural world and the teachings of Zivara.

With Au'lun and Arden waiting on the other side, Arden taking the opportunity to connect with nature,  Peridot, Tova, Enyawd and Nero start to make their way accross the rope.

Peridot, being light on his feet is easily able to traverse the rope and make it safely to the other side.

Tova, being short and heavy (not fat ü§£) for a dwarf needs to enlist the help of her kin to reach the rope and after what seems like an eternity to her, she also makes it to the other side.

With the wind staring to pick up and clouds staring to form causing the rope to swing wildly Enyawd starts to make his way accross. Despite the winds, and Enyawd's lighter dwarven frame he is able to hold on and make it accross.

With the clouds overhead becomming all the more dark and gloomy, Nero starts to make his way accross the chasm. The winds ebb and flow as the rains start to fall causing the rope to become slippery...making it just over half way, Nero...please give me a Dexterity Saving throw as your hands, now wet from the rain starts to slip...

Your sorcery points can be spent to recover a spell slot (levitate is a 2nd level spell thus requiring 3 sorcery points to replace the slot... do you want to spend all 3?)

It is usually recommended to wait, just coz sone things might not even need a check or depending on what the party does the checks could be different giving different information.
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 9:56 AM
Because I am running these games as one shots and not a campaign it is easier to just use milestone. The idea will be to complete the "game" or "scene" and then start the next game at the next level... whether with this character or another ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 10:05 AM
Now at the other side of the chasm, you all take a few minutes to bandage your wounds and catch your breath...Looking around you see this part of the forest is much more dense than on the other side, clearly this part gets much less traffic. Continuing to the tomb will be much more difficult from this point on, the dense undergrowth slowing your progress as you have to stop and clear a path for most of the way.

As you prepare to set off, Arden using his connection and expertise in nature looks around, trying to find any tracks or evidence of movement and signs that you are going in the right direction as the map is not as accurate on the details as you would like. While Arden is drawing on his knowledge of nature, what is the rest of the party doing...i.e. are there any skills you would try to utilize to assist in this situation and how would you do it?
Jarrod ‚Äî Today at 10:07 AM
Peridot will look for a fairly tall tree to climb to try and get a vantage point for scoping out a possible cave or somewhere they could be safe to take a rest

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 10:27 AM
The trees on this side of the chasm is much harder to climb, branches are high and the rain that is now starting to get heavier makes it more.of a challenge to get a good hold, yet with your training you are able to scale the tree, getting to 80ft -90ft high. Looking around, the trees create a canopy, but off in the distance, perhaps within another 30min of walking you see what could be a space for the party to take cover... a little alcove in the mountain. Beyond that, you see way off in the distance, the outline of the tomb you are looking for.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 4:05 PM
Arden, using the map and your knowledge of nature you are able to spot some animal tracks, broken branches and other signs left by smaller game indicating a possible safe path to travel along. This combined with Peridot's information helps to set a direction of travel. During your next 20min walk Tova, Au'lun, Peridot, Enyawd and Nero will keep a cautious eye on the surrounding forest, using sight, smell and sound to look for any signs of danger.

With Arden's direction, you pass by and manages to avaoid a small patch of brightly coloured flowers, the area around it filled with the bones of animals of all sorts, carcasses in various stages of decomposition combined with the humidity makes the smell almost unbearable, although you believe slightly better with the current spat of rain...the rain that is now causing every step to feel like a fight to escape from the earth itself.

You finally make it to where the alcove is in sight, just 30ft away as Au'lun and Nero steps forward to investigate the surroundings, with Enyawd ready to investigate the interior to ensure it to be a safe space to take a much needed rest.

Au'lun please give me a survival check as you are trying to determine the presence of any animals in the area.

Nero, please give me a perception check.

Enyawd, looking at the alcove, set in the side of the mountain... to the right is an opening shaped in a semi-circular form 25ft high and about 35ft from left to right. Most of the entrance is covered in vines hanging from the surrounding undergrowth atop the opening Looking past the vines it seems about 10ft deep. To the left, there is a smaller opening a narrow crevasse that seems would be possible to squeeze into. From your current viewpoint with your dark vision you can see into the darkness beyond the opening,  it seems much deeper... seemingly 20ft before it looks like it turns and heads even deeper.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 4:40 PM
Au'lun... looking around at the surrounding area, the ground here seems undisturbed. You do not see any trace of animal in this area. The undergrowth in the area is thick and the rain might have wasged away much of the tracks.

Nero, you still have the smell of dead flesh stuck in your senses... perhaps a wolf or a wild boar, you are mot certain but ot seems to linger in the air as you walk around the alcove opening looking for signs of life...or death.

Enyawd, making your way closer to the entrance, looking at signs of disturbance in the surrounding area you find nothing but the vines hiding the entrance.

Arden, sensing the eerie stillness in the forest, furrows his brow in concern. He quietly motions to his companions to remain still. Using his keen perception, honed by years of living in the wilderness, he listens intently to the natural sounds around them, searching for any hint of what might be amiss. His eyes scan the surroundings, looking for any unusual movement or signs of wildlife. Arden's hand gently touches the ground, feeling for vibrations. He knows that understanding the source of this unnatural quietness is crucial for their safety, relying on his instincts and experience to guide them through this tense moment.

Enyawd, you slowly and cautiously make your way through the overhanging vines and towards the crevasse to the left, stepping over more tree roots as the forest seems to claim all the nutrients here they can find. You peer into the darkness...  it is quiet, you see nothing but a rough natural stone wall. The water pouring out of the sky causes the sound of dripping water deeper into the cave. You head forward, 20ft untill you are able to see further down and around the bend. The cave seems to go much further but the vines and roots from the trees above make it hard to navigate this area. You would have to cut through to make it further should you wish to continue.

Arden, ready to face whatever danger might present itself waits to hear from his companions... Tova, Au'lun and Peridot stand ready as well... Au'lun holding his breath to drown out the lingering smell of the decaying creatures you just past.

As you slice through the vines, the vines accross the entrance immediately extend in length and thickness, slamming and digging into the ground beneath covering the entire entrance of the crevasse and you watch as the vines you are slicing through start to move and you feel the ground beneath your feet and the wall.of the cavern itself start to rumble...

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Deformiter (Arden) ‚Äî Today at 10:28 PM
Arden begins to examine the vines that have closed off the entrance to the alcove. With a gentle touch, he feels their texture and observes their growth patterns, seeking to understand their unusual behavior. Arden murmurs softly in the language of the woods, a dialogue between the druid and the flora, as he attempts to discern if these vines are simply a natural occurrence or something influenced by a more arcane presence. His connection with the forest deepens as he listens for its silent responses, hoping to unveil the mysteries these vines may hold‚Äã‚Äã.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 11:01 PM
With a 21... Focusing on your knowledge of nature you recall having heard of a creature called an Assassin Vine... An ambulatory plant that collects its fertilizer by grabbing and crushing prey and depositing the carcasses near its roots. It lives by the rules of nature...cruelty and kindness, it has no sense of this, it is driven by instinct to feed.

Recognizing the plant's instinctual nature, Arden opts to harmonize with it rather than combat it. He steps closer to the vines, his hands outstretched in a peaceful gesture, whispering an ancient druidic chant. The intent is not to control or harm, but to communicate and appease, to reach an understanding with the primal force of nature driving these vines, seeking a way to coexist without conflict. 
Can I ? üòÖ
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 11:14 PM
I'd say, unless you have a specific spell to try and communicate wit the plants you won't be able to convince a totally random plant to abandon its most basic instinctual drive and be your friend üòÇ (also it has an intelligence of 1... it doesn't understand the concept)

Arden... I'd give you one more bit of knowledge with your roll of 21 earlier... They attack anything in a 30ft area... currently Tova, Enyawd and Nero is stuck in a cavern, blocked off by this vine on both ends. Also, as they are connected to the forest, they draw water from the surrounding area making them resistant to fire damage.

Cool... so you rush in, squeezing through the crevasse and the vines covering the opening, now pulled by by Arden's magic.  Moving deeper and around the corner you see Nero entangled by the vines and beyond him Tova and Enyawd blocked by more vines and tree roots.

Although hard to see at this point as the light fades as you take the bend, with only the torch dropped by Enyawd to guide you (as you do not have dark vision) you focus on the vines beyond Enyawd and cast hunter's mark, locking on to the target and focusing your attack towards it.

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 5:55 PM
As you slice through the vines, releasing its grip on Nero you see the vines beyond Enyawd and Tova start to shrivel up and fall limp.

Arden, concentrating on his spell to keep the vines at the entrance parted, also feels the tension releaseas the vines there retract back towards the top of the alcove... The way forward clear... those without darkvision not able to see further in and those with dark vision seeing a much larger portion still to be explored...
I think I shall leave it there for today... I still have some family stuff to get done so I will continue tomorrow.
In the meantime... you can decide whether you want to explore the rest of the cave or take this time to take a rest and recover from all the excitement.
Those who can see in further will see a pathway fulled with narrow ledges and long ways down...
Enyawd Nightbeard ‚Äî Today at 5:59 PM
Enyawd thinks exploration would be good, but considering all the excitement it might be best to lick the wounds and rest.

Arden has a few spell slots still, but no Wild Shape left - he does have Darkvision though, also still full HP - perhaps he can go forward and explore a bit while the others rest? He also has Trance, which means he only needs to meditate for 4 hours, which is the equivilent to an 8 hour rest for Humans (is that a long rest?)

Arden, decides to use his time before his watch to meditate (Trance (meditate semiconsciously for 4 hours, gaining the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep)). He finds a serene spot nearby, away from the sleeping arrangements but close enough to keep an eye on the group. Sitting cross-legged, Arden closes his eyes, inhaling the earthy aroma of the forest and the cave. He begins a deep, rhythmic breathing, each exhale releasing the day's stress. His mind clears, focusing on the teachings of Zivara, seeking inner peace and balance. This meditative state is not just for his own rejuvenation, but also serves as a subtle, calming influence on his companions, emanating a sense of tranquility and safety within the camp.

Tova and Peridot... With the continuing rain outside you constantly hear a drip...drip...drip as the water is seeping through the cracks and into the cave. Peridot,  listening the the sounds of the water, you can hear the deeper into the cave there must be an enormous cavern. Also taking a moment to listen to the rate at which you hear the sounds of the water dripping you gather that the bottom of the cave could be a graveyard for anyone not careful.

You also hear the sounds of bats as they move within the caves and occasionally you hear a small rock shifting or falling or perhaps a scurrying in the distance. However during your 3 hours, no threat presents itself...

You only need 6 of the 8 to actually be sleep... but you can sleep as long as you feel you want to. This might come in handy later if you wanted to look at crafting or brewing or any such things or just something to think of for your dnd game in general.

Arden keeps a vigilant watch, his senses attuned to the subtle movements and sounds of the forest and sounds within the cave, ensuring the safety of the group during this necessary interlude‚Äã‚Äã. He decides to gather some of the now dead vines to repurpose them and use them to create an Eldomyn, a symbol which represents the unity between the spiritual and material worlds, it symbolizes the interconnectedness of life and the cyclical nature of existence. It reflects the philosophy of Zivara, emphasizing the divine essence in everything. The Eldomyn, mirroring natural patterns, is a tool for meditation and spiritual exploration. It is usually expressed in various forms like jewelry or art, serving as a reminder of Zivara's teachings and the spiritual journey.

With a little more focus, now walking to where the vines obstructed the party's movement and listening again... you hear it again... It's faint, maybe small feet maybe just the bats...

Arden, takes a moment to assess the situation. He focuses on the large creature in the cavern, utilizing his druidic knowledge and keen sense of nature. He quietly observe the creature's behaviour and movements, trying to discern its nature and intentions. He listens for the sounds it makes and watches its interaction with the environment, hoping to identify more about it.

Having seen the outline of this creature, looking at the environment, and the way it moves, trying to recall more information about what this creature could be you do get a sense that this is something larger than your eyes lead you to believe... A creature capable of seeing in the dark, capable of ambusing its pray, large, long body, insect like...

Arden raises an eyebrow, giving Enyawd a bit of a stink eye while showing him the classic "shush" gesture
Nightbeard clan ‚Äî Today at 3:43 PM
"You expect a dwarf to be silent without a hearty breakfast? Were you truly born in a stable?" Enyawd whispers.
Enyawd hopes Nero doesn't clatter into something while he goes about his morning business after donning his armor.

Nero snorts out of his dream with a startled mutter ....mother....before his tattoos flash a very subtle hue signaling that his powers have again returned to him he flexes his forearm looking his runes before noticing the tension in the group.....noticing something is up Nero nods at Enyawd and arden before slowly getting up and slinking over to see whatever everyone seems to be looking at.

Even though Enyawd's lack is breakfast is causing him concern, he and Nero keeps focus and the party is able to stay undetected...

After another tense 4 hours, everyone is able to get a full rest... The cavern still dark and then threat out of sight but possibly still lurking below, the party stares into the unknown.

Do you continue forward into the cave or do you continue on your way through the forest to the Tomb?
Turtlebaff420 ‚Äî Today at 4:37 PM
Being a bounty hunter and living for the hunt Nero is tempted to chase after the beast as it may fetch a good price on the market....but won't go alone so he waits on the group vote

So it's 2 v 1 on the vote so far? Tova , arden and al'lun still to vote?
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 4:52 PM
You are looking for 2 things... a cavern deep in the mountains (by the markings on the map it is not this cavern) and a tomb atop a hill. Gregory's men has identified these 2 places as places where the "leaders" might be... or just serves to give more info on the goblins
Peridot will recall talking to a woman at the store in town who said that as a young girl she heard stories of a tomb where goblins took young girls to sacrifice them.
Turtlebaff420 ‚Äî Today at 5:00 PM
"Suppose we have a lot on our plate already huh? so perhaps we follow  peridots advice," Nero says as he leans over to Enyawd. "Sorry old boi perhaps someday we will return and challenge that wee biestie to a throw down ...."

Arden, feeling the familiar call of the forest, voices his agreement to return to the woods. His demeanor reflects a sense of confidence and belonging, his spirit uplifted by the prospect of being surrounded by the familiar embrace of the forest.

"Suppose it's unanimous then " Nero remarks as he spins his handaxe and slots it into his belt. Getting ready to quietly group up to leave

Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 8:16 PM
Lead by Arden you spend the good portion of the morning traveling towards what he says is the way to the Tomb...but sometimes it feels like you might have passed this area before. Tova and Peridot alert and scanning the surrounding undergrowth, with every rabbit being a potential danger as Nero, Enwayd and Au'lun are much more relaxed... 

Getting close to where the Tomb is drawn on the map you start to see the jungle change, the plants look withered and the sounds of insects are quieter, the trees seems like the life has been drained from them.

Continuing on, you find yourself 200ft away in the treeline and at yet another cave entrance. This one slightly different, 2 large wooden doors have been built to cover this cave entrance, with one door on the floor, broken down and the other hanging halfway on the hinges.

Each member, please give me another perception or survival or investigation check... whichever you think will be best suited to your character and tell me what you hope to find using this skill

Tova will stop and look around their area to see if there are any tracks/foot prints, any thing else that looks man or goblin made like the doors, listen if she hears any voices.  I think this will be perception?

Having hunted many a trophy Nero would like to investigate as well for any signs of a camping quarters or any signs that the entrance had been recently been disturbed
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 9:14 PM
As you make your way to the cave entrance, Tova and Peridot you notice that the muddy ground  infront of the Tomb has been trampled by a mixture of creatures. Peridot, going down on one knee to more clearly identify the tracks is able to see a mixture of goblin, animal and perhaps spider-like imprints... though they do not follow the normal 8 legged patern... 

Nero and Au'lun. Just beyond the door looking into the cave is a 20ft by 20ft room with crates stacked up against the far side wall and a 30ft long, 5ft wide hallway set of stairs to the right leading down, then a 5ft by 5ft landing and then more stairs leading down into the darkness...

Enyawd, looking at the door itself you notice that a large creature must have broken this down as the locking mechanism is still intact but the door is not.

Arden, looking around and using your connection to the forest you het the feeling that something if off, the forest is a reflection of that which inhabits it and looking around you see nothing good...
Basically_A_Chicken ‚Äî Today at 9:28 PM
Which way did the door fall?
Setto Kaiba ‚Äî Today at 9:35 PM
Inwards... thus it was broken from the outside... long...ago...
Nightbeard clan ‚Äî Today at 9:37 PM
Is the cave stonework?
